Projects almost always require financial support which you will raise through activities. You should always consider the sustainability of your projects before undertaking them. Supporters will want to see evidence of sustainability and you may need to plan to run further activities that raise finances for maintenance and repairs in future.</div>
                                            <p>Projects are the fuel to your school or organisational objectives. So if one of your school objectives is to provide both high quality and a diverse set of sports, then one of your projects may be redeveloping your sports hall to cater for more than just football. Applying for a grant for your sports facility, for example, may be an activity you undertake to accomplish your project.</p>

But who are your stakeholders? They may be pupilsâ€™ parents, even pupils themselves if they have a desire to learn a particular skill. They may be a local organisation driving for specific mathematical or scientific skills to be taught in local schools in order to harvest those later on in apprenticeships. <br />You need to appeal to all of your potential donors when you write your narrative. For example, you want to invest in iPads in order to increase the employability of your pupils by teaching specific skills which they can learn through interactive iPad use; and also provide resources to the wider community.
