                                            <h1>Importing ParentPay Transactions</h1>
                                            <p>Depending on whether you use the ParentPay Collection Service or are on Direct Settlement you will need to follow a similar procedure in Fund Manager to match your pupil ePayments.</p>
                                            <p>The principle of this exercise is broken down into 5 stages:</p>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li value="1">Understanding what type of account you have for settlement from ParentPay</li>
                                                <li value="2">Generating a file within ParentPay of all the transactions that you want to import</li>
                                                <li value="3">Adjusting the file so the data is correct</li>
                                                <li value="4">Importing the file into Fund Manager</li>
                                                <li value="5">Dealing with Negative payments</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>It is important to note that this process can only be used for importing ePayment transactions. Although cash and cheque transactions can be recorded in ParentPay they cannot be imported into Fund Manager using this process. If you have any transactions in the file that should not be imported use the guidelines in stage 3 to remove these transactions.</p>
                                            <h4>Step 1 -  Understanding what type of account you have for ParentPay settlements</h4>
                                            <p>As a school using ParentPay you will either have monies deposited to your designated bank accounts every fortnight for the periods 1st -15th and 16th – end of the month.  This method of deposit to your designated bank account uses the ParentPay Collection Service.</p>
                                            <p>or</p>
                                            <p>If your school has ParentPay deposits going directly into your own schools’ bank accounts (usually daily) then this means you are on Direct Settlement.</p>
                                            <p>Whichever type of ParentPay account you have in school you need to decide how you will import into Fund Manager:</p>
                                            <blockquote>
                                                <p>If you wish to assign each individual ePayment to each pupil that has paid via ParentPay you should generate and import your ParentPay file to the ParentPay Settlement Account in Fund Manager and then transfer the money once imported to the appropriate bank account/s to reconcile to your statements.</p>
                                            </blockquote>
                                            <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">or</p>
                                            <blockquote>
                                                <p>You will need to create a generic account in Fund Manager  for transactions to settle to if you do not wish to assign ePayments directly to an individual pupil but to import as a bulk receipt, typically this would be called e.g. ParentPay Receipts. If you choose this method then you need only record the receipts/payments from your bank statement (credits/debits) as they appear on your statement or in advance using your Collection Service Statement/Invoices, reconciling these amounts to your bank statement when it arrives.  If you choose this method you do not need to do anything further.</p>
                                            </blockquote>
                                            <p>If you are assigning payments to individual pupils - recommended:</p>
                                            <h4>Collection Service Only:</h4>
                                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                                <li value="1">Firstly you need to check that the money you have received from ParentPay to your designated bank account matches the Collection Service Statement.  You do this in ParentPay:</li>
                                                <p>Go to Reports &gt;&#160;Reports.</p>
                                                <p>Choose report &gt; Collection Service Statements.</p>
                                                <p>Use the filters to check your bank credit against the available statements/dates.</p>
                                                <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="Note: "><span class="autonumber"><span class="Emphasis">Note: </span></span>The difference between your gross and your net settlement should be your Collection Service Invoices which you can enter as a direct debit payment in Fund Manager.</p>
                                                <li value="2">	For a Collection Service Settlement Receipt – record as a Payment (direct debit) your charges from your ParentPay Collection Service Invoice to balance the 2 week period credited to your bank account to a Fund Manager account named e.g. ‘ParentPay Bank Charges’.  Best practice would be to reconcile from the 1st – 15th of the month and then 16th to the end of the month to match ParentPay’s Collection Service Statements/Invoices. By doing the above your receipts and payments will match your gross ePayments taken in ParentPay as per the Collection Service Statement.  You can then go to 3 below.</li>

Upload the CSV file you have just saved by choosing the file and clicking the Upload button.  A list of all the transactions that you have imported should appear similar to the screen below.  From this screen you will need to select the Account and the Settlement Account you wish to allocate the transactions against from the drop-down list.  If you do not already have one, create a suitable Settlement Account from within Fund Manager (<span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Bank Accounts &gt; Create New Account</span>).  Using a Settlement Account allows individual ePayments to be recorded in Fund Manager and then once imported you can transfer the total amount from the Settlement Account into your desired Bank Account.</p>
                                            <p>Work through each of the transactions selecting and matching Name from the drop-down list. The closest matching name should appear at the top of the names list.</p>
