        <h1>What is new?</h1>
        <p>The screens have been redesigned to help you do your work. As well as this there are a lot of new features which you have been asking for.</p>
        <h3>Trip tool</h3>
        <p> The trip tool is pre-populated with a list of things needed for trips, for example, fixed costs or sundries. This might be car parking charges for the trip or plan B costs (what happens if the trip is weather dependent and needs to be cancelled). </p>
        <p>You can add to what is already there so you can tailor the list of item costs in the trip for your own trip.</p>
        <h3>Transaction audit trail</h3>
        <p>You now have an audit trail of transactions, so that you have full traceability for your auditors.</p>
        <h3>Bulk transfers</h3>
        <p>You can now make bulk transfers between user and bank accounts.</p>
        <h3>Define your financial year</h3>
        <p>The majority of schools start their year on 1/9 but there is now a flag which you can select that indicates the start of the year, for example, 1/9 or 1/4, which follows the financial year.</p>
        <h3>Define and set budget that spans more than 12 months</h3>
        <p>You can now define a budget that spans years, if required. For example, you could define a budget that spans 15 months and crosses your financial years.</p>
        <h3>Separation of duty</h3>
        <p> You can now ensure that specific actions can only be done by other staff members. You might want to do this so that the person entering transactions isn’t the person who runs reports, or who posts receipts to the bank.</p>
        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <p>This is always confusing as the same terms mean different things to different people, so we have created a glossary of the terms we use which will help you understand what we mean. For example, when we refer to budget, we mean budget revenue i.e. the income that trips bring in, rather than a budget to spend.</p>
        <h3>Guidance for schools that are becoming academies</h3>
        <p>If your school is becoming an academy, we offer guidance on when to change over, the financial year to use and the date to start.</p>
        <h3>Search Transactions</h3>
        <p>You can now filter transactions by account and print all at the same time instead of having to print each account transactions separately.</p>
