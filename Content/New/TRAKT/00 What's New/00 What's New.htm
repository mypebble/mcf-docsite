        <h1>What's New?</h1>
        <p>Trakt is the new Fund Manager, redesigned to help you work more effectively to manage your school fund. </p>
        <p>So we begin with Fund Manager, rename the product as Trakt, and introduce new features and options which will make your working life easier.</p>
        <p>If you are a completely new user, you do not need to read this section because all of the software will be new to you, so we recommend that you begin with the next section - Introduction. If you are someone who has used Fund Manager in the past, you can keep track of what changes within this section.</p>
