        <h1>How to use Trakt</h1>
        <p>Trakt is software that helps you to manage your school fund accounts. The dashboard provides a quick overview of all transactions.</p>
        <p>Trakt is cloud-hosted which means that you can access it from any computer with your logon details and you don’t have to worry about security. Our excellent security standards ensure that you are in control of your data at all times.</p>
        <p>Multiple users in your organisation can log on to Trakt at the same time so you can assign different tasks to different members of staff as required. </p>
        <p>Trakt integrates with online payment providers, such as Nochex, Capita and sQuid, and with all MIS applications (ParentPay, ParentMail, Schoolcomms, Schoolmoney and PMX) to import relevant pupil information.</p>
