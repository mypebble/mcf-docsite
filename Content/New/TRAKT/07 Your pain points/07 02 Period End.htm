        <h1>Period End</h1>
        <p>12/8 is Scottish school beginning of year</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The following = approx 95% of all eventualities.</p>
        <p>PE = 31/8 if school year - tends to be for academies e.g. 85% of 95%</p>
        <p>PE = 31/3 if calendar year - tends to be other e.g. 10% of 95%.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Tracked - needs to have a flag set initially for Period End when first set up for use. That's captured so we can flag up help to them at period end time.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>They may need to change their period end when the convert from a state school to an academy.</p>
        <p>We also need to have something which pops up = a checklist/wizard for Period End e.g.</p>
        <p>Period End</p>
        <p>1 Do A &#160;Green Tick</p>
        <p>2</p>
        <p>3</p>
        <p>4</p>
        <p>5</p>
        <p>,,,</p>
        <p>n</p>
        <p>You're done. Crack open the champagne!</p>
