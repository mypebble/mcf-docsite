        <h1>About Arro<MadCap:concept term="Arro" /></h1>
        <p>Government funding of education is being reduced all the time but this needn’t mean a reduction in or an end to some of your educational services. You can generate all the income you need to fund your services and even add new services.</p>
        <p>Research shows that by 2017 a typical secondary school will need to find an extra £200,000 per year to stay afloat. That may seem daunting but there are plenty of ways you can go about raising money - <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="PebbleGlossary.Term63">sponsorship</MadCap:glossaryTerm>, donations, grants, events, hosting clubs on school sites or providing services in the community. And Pebble’s Arro software is ideally positioned to help you manage your income generation.</p>
        <h3>What do you need to generate income?</h3>

            <li>A way of managing your income generation - and this is where Pebble Arro comes in!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Arro is comprised of eight modules:</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Projects</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>This is where you begin. where you input information about the exciting educational projects you have in mind.</p>
                <p>Always plan your project with thought about potential funders. What is their perspective and what will they get out of it? Will it help them achieve their objectives? This is part of building your relationship with the local community.</p>
                <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Projects</span> module will guide you through the process for writing winning narratives you can use when you apply for grants.</p>
                <p>We know how busy things can be in schools and so you can easily share your <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="PebbleGlossary.Term53">project narratives</MadCap:glossaryTerm> with your colleagues and ask for their comments, advice and feedback, helping you to hone these before proceeding to make any grant applications.</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Grants</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Having planned your project, now you must seek potential funders for it. This is where your project narrative really begins to work for you.</p>
                <p>Applying for funding takes time, so don’t wait until a few days before the deadline to complete your grant application. Make sure you have everything ready in advance.</p>
                <p>There are a number of potential sources for new grants and funding opportunities that can be accessed through the <span class="Emphasis">Grants</span> module <span class="Emphasis">Search</span>. Through the <span class="Emphasis">Admin</span> option you can see the grant deadlines. Throughout the year, expired grants are made available with new deadlines.</p>
                <p>In addition you can find news of new grants and other funding opportunities through <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="PebbleGlossary.Term62">social media</MadCap:glossaryTerm>.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>At any time you may receive donations from benefactors. <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="PebbleGlossary.Term18">Donors</MadCap:glossaryTerm> are people who sympathise with your aims - perhaps old pupils, old staff members, parents of existing pupils or parents who want to invest in the school for their future children or grandchildren.</p>
                <p>These will come in <i>ad hoc</i> and you may never have more than written communication with your donors but often you can find a way to involve them - if it is something that they want - in presenting school prizes, or naming the benefactor in school publications and so on.</p>
                <p>Donations may come with <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="PebbleGlossary.Term27">Gift Aid</MadCap:glossaryTerm>, provided you are registered as a charity with the government and the donor pays sufficient income tax in the year.</p>

                <p>Income generation may come in through different types of relationship - your <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="PebbleGlossary.Term66">stakeholder</MadCap:glossaryTerm> relationships. The different types of relationship or profile types are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pupil</li>
                    <li>Parent/Guardian</li>
                    <li>
                        <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="PebbleGlossary.Term0">Alumni</MadCap:glossaryTerm>
                    </li>
                    <li>Staff</li>
                    <li>Person</li>
                    <li>Business</li>
                    <li>Community Organisation</li>

                    <li>Organisation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The <span class="Emphasis">SRM</span> module is where you manage your stakeholder relationships, including whether stakeholders are eligible for Gift Aid and are interesting in volunteering to help you out.</p>
