        <div class="quotation">Selling your school services in the wider community<br />You will find that you can sell your in-house expertise in the community during out of school hours. For example, if you have IT&#160;knowledge, or sport coaches within your knowledge bank at school, you can generate revenue by providing specialised assistance to organisations outside the school. This has two effects - it brings in more revenue to the school and it increases the community awareness about the school and it’s values and what it can offer the community.</div>
        <div class="quotation">In addition you can also trade your services with other schools, filling in the gaps for each other and generating revenue for all of you.</div>
        <p>The Services module is where you can manage the portfolio of your school’s potentially profitable services and also manage the qualification / approval of individuals and organisation who request the use of your services.</p>
        <p>In the Services module, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Record and audit the services you offer.</li>
            <li>Create check lists  to qualify people applying to hire or lease school services.</li>
            <li>Calculate the cost of sale per item offered.</li>
            <li>Market your portfolio.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can build your services portfolio by adding items from scratch or by adding services from a number of templates (e.g. IT security, sports coaching, photocopying) and tailoring these to match your own offering. Once you have created items in your portfolio you can add images of the services and terms and conditions documents, so all of the information about what is on offer is held in the same place.</p>
