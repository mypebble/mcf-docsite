        <div class="quotation">The Importance of Donors and Donations<br />Altruism is a means of feeling good about yourself and at the same time knowing you are helping to make a difference to a worthy cause. In addition, the UK government rewards the altruism of donation by providing relief on the tax paid on donations to charities from UK taxpayers, thereby increasing the revenue to the charity by 25%. This costs ordinary rate taxpayers nothing. Higher rate taxpayers receive tax refunds of the difference between the rate they pay and the basic rate on the donation. Gift Aid is a win-win situation.</div>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Donations</span> module is where you record donations and can record and report on Gift Aid qualifying transactions. Gift Aid is a way of achieving a 25% uplift on your donations.</p>
        <p>To benefit from the Gift Aid scheme, your organisation must be a charity or have charitable status and your donor must be a UK taxpayer. For more information and to ensure that your organisation is eligible to receive gift aid, see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-gift-aid" target="_blank">HMRC requirements for claiming gift aid</a>.</p>
        <p>You can set up a donations button on your Joinos Web Page so that people can donate directly to your projects.</p>
        <h2><a name="SetGiftAidDonor"></a>Set up a gift aid donor</h2>
        <p>Gift Aid donors are UK taxpayers. You can set up gift aid donors, using the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="PebbleGlossary.Term65">[%=ArroModules.SRM%]</MadCap:glossaryTerm> (Stakeholder Relationship Management module or you can add a gift aid donor using the <span class="Name">+ Add Name</span> option on the <span class="Name">Record Donation</span> form.</p>
