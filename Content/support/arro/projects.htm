        <div class="quotation">The Importance of Projects<br />In order to achieve your vision you will need to run projects that deliver on the goals that support it. Projects almost always require financial support which you will raise through activities. You should always consider the sustainability of your projects before undertaking them. Supporters will want to see evidence of sustainability and you may need to plan to run further activities that raise finances for maintenance and repairs in future.</div>

        <p>You can create community pages for your projects. These help you to promote your project and also act as a focal point for donations of time and money towards the project. Once you have created the project community page, you can promote it by sharing the URL to the page and creating campaigns to promote it. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Audiences.Development Service">If you have purchased the Development Service, you can download automatically created flyers to send out to parents and businesses in the community about your project.</MadCap:conditionalText> You can share the project directly on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn, using the sharing buttons, just as if you were sharing a news article on social media.</p>

                            <p>Although the question is posed with a <i>why</i> question, your answer should really be a succinct <i>what</i> and <i>why</i>. Your answer must encompass the entire reason for the project and so adequately explain to your donors the reasons for the associated fundraising.  You will need to research or have an idea of who the potential stakeholders in your project will be in order to appeal directly to them within this answer.
</p>
                            <div class="example">For example, you want iPads available in classrooms to engage your pupils in specific interactive learning techniques available through iPad use and address the underachievement of pupils in maths or science. But who are your stakeholders? They may be pupils’ parents, even pupils themselves if they have a desire to learn a particular skill. They may be a local organisation driving for specific mathematical or scientific skills to be taught in local schools in order to harvest those later on in apprenticeships. <br />You need to appeal to all of your potential donors when you write your narrative. For example, you want to invest in iPads in order to increase the employability of your pupils by teaching specific skills which they can learn through interactive iPad use; and also provide resources to the wider community.
