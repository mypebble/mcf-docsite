        <div class="quotation">The Importance of Sponsors and Sponsorship<br />Sponsors can be a mainstay of project support. Partnering with businesses is a mutually beneficial endeavour – your school receives support for your projects (monetary or otherwise) and your business partner will reap rewards as well, such as fostering positive relations with their future workforce, promotional opportunities to members of your school community and fulfilling their corporate social responsibilities.</div>
        <p>The Sponsors module is where you can manage your relationships with your sponsors and prospective major donors. The layout of the module will ensure you are always up-to-date and know who to call upon when you need to ask for support for your projects. You can search across your sponsors for those who support different types of project and keep in touch with your sponsors to let them know how their sponsorship is making a difference to your project.</p>
        <p>Four things to keep in mind when working with Sponsors are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your Joinos Community page will be a source of potential sponsorship leads.</li>
            <li>Businesses and business owners will be interested in sponsoring school projects as part of their corporate social responsibility plans.</li>
            <li>Marketing campaigns can easily be set up and set as recurring within the <MadCap:variable name="ArroModules.Campaigns" />&#160;module to assist you in attracting sponsors on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Face-to-face networking is also a mainstay of obtaining sponsors. Every social interaction is an opportunity to spread the word that you are looking for sponsors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <span class="Name">Sponsors</span> module links to the <span class="Name"><MadCap:variable name="ArroModules.Campaigns" /></span>&#160;(Stakeholder Relationship Management) module.</p>
        <h2>Managing your sponsors</h2>
        <p>When you access the <span class="Name">Sponsorship</span> module, you get an overview of your leads in a pipeline dashboard. This lets you see at a glance how your sponsorship is building - how many new leads you have to work with, how many have been qualified, pledged and completed. The goal is to get as many completed as possible, so it is very encouraging to see lots of new leads coming into the pipeline to work with and rewarding to see them move up the pipeline too.</p>

        <h2>How do I build a sponsor network?</h2>
        <p>When you first begin to use this module it will be empty and you need to build your sponsor network. Sponsors are added automatically when the sponsor enters their details on the <span class="Name">Enquire Online</span> form within the <span class="Name">Sponsors</span> section of your <span class="Name">Joinos Community</span> Page. You can build your network by creating a campaign within the <MadCap:variable name="ArroModules.Campaigns" /> module to contact your existing stakeholders in <MadCap:variable name="ArroModules.Campaigns" /> to invite them to sponsor your projects. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="srm.htm#campaigns">Campaigns</MadCap:xref>. Within the Sponsors module, you can <a href="#AddingManually">add sponsors manually</a>.</p>
        <h2>Adding new leads</h2>
        <p>Leads are added automatically when the sponsor enters their details on the <span class="Name">Sponsorship</span> form on your <span class="Name">Joinos Community</span> Page. You can add sponsorship records manually into the Sponsorship module.</p>
        <h4>Getting sponsors through your community page</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure your Joinos Community page is published as the sponsorship form is available for selection on this page.</li>
            <p>The sponsorship form collects the <span class="Name">Name</span>, <span class="Name">Company</span>, <span class="Name">Telephone</span> and <span class="Name">Email</span> address of the potential sponsor and automatically creates a sponsorship record in the Sponsors module, with a status of <i>Prospect</i>.</p>
            <p>When a sponsor is added automatically, you receive an email notification of the sponsor’s interest so that you can follow up with them, and the sponsor receives on-screen confirmation that their enquiry has been sent. You will find the sponsor name listed in the <span class="Name">New Leads</span> section on the Sponsorship dashboard.</p>
        </ul>
        <h4><a name="AddingManually"></a>Manually from within the Sponsors module</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that you have all the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="PebbleGlossary.Term87">sponsorship lead sheets</MadCap:glossaryTerm> collected.</li>
        </ul>

        <p MadCap:conditions="Versions.Exclude">Sponsor amounts c/o Scott - When we record a sponsor amount, the value of the amount should be assigned to the project the sponsor is currently assigned to. If the sponsor subsequently changes project, the amount should remain against the original project. Queried with Scott on 28/11/16 - does this mean the initial amount stays with the first project chosen and any subsequent amounts go to the project the sponsor has changed to? Scott said he needed to catch up with Sam before committing to an answer.</p>
