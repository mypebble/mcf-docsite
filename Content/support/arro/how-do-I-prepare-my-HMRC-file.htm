        <h1>How do I prepare my HMRC file?</h1>
        <p class="Tip" MadCap:autonum="Tip: ">You can view screens on this page at full size by clicking on the thumbnail image.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Objective</span> - Populate the HMRC Gift Aid Donation Schedule  | <span class="Emphasis"> Result </span>- Submit completed Gift Aid Donation Schedule</p>
        <p>Once you have collected a number of donations and confirmed you hold Gift Aid declarations for each donor, you can proceed to complete the Gift Aid claim form. This will be a relatively smooth process.</p>
        <h2>Completing Your Gift Aid Claim</h2>
        <p>All the outstanding eligible transactions are reported.  These can be found under <span class="Name">Donations &gt; View Archived Claims</span>.  You can then download them to a CSV Excel file which is then used to populate the HMRC charities form.</p>
        <p>Select your desired claim which will show you the breakdown of Donations and give you the ability to download your form and/or CSV file via the <span class="Name">Actions</span> button at the bottom right hand side of the screen.</p>
        <p>

        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">You <span class="Emphasis">must</span> download the HMRC Gift Aid Form from the <span class="Name">Actions</span> menu to complete the following steps as well as your CSV if you have not done already.</p>
        <p class="Tip" MadCap:autonum="Tip: ">When downloading your CSV file from Arro, you can either open it straight away or choose where you would like to save it to.   If you’re a Google Chrome user, you can select the file and use the Show In Folder option to locate your file.</p>
        <h2>Preparing Your Schedule</h2>
        <p>Once you have downloaded your Exported CSV file from Donations, you must highlight and select the columns that hold information only.  You should have the following nine fields in your file:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>	Title</li>
            <li>First Name</li>
            <li>	Last Name</li>
            <li>House Name or Number</li>
            <li>Postcode</li>
            <li>Aggregated Donations</li>
            <li>Sponsored Event (Yes/Blank)</li>
            <li>Donation Date ( DD/MM/YYYY)</li>
            <li>Amount</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/CSVScheduleHMRC.png" class="Thumbnail" />
        </p>
        <p>The next step is to open the Gift Aid Form and select <span class="Name">Enable Editing</span> from the top of the report.  Please carefully read through the HMRC guidelines at the top of the file.</p>
        <p>Now you must paste in your donations from your exported CSV file into the Donations Schedule Table on the HMRC Gift Aid Form which will populate the relevant fields.  The total on the Gift Aid Form should now automatically update.</p>
        <p>Once you have finished adding your data, save the file as an .ods file and <span class="Emphasis">not</span> a Microsoft Excel .xlsx file, for example; <i>Gift Aid Jan 2015.ods</i>.</p>
