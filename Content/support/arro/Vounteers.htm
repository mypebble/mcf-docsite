        <div class="quotation">The Gift of Time<br />You will find that some people like to donate their time in addition to donating money, or just are more comfortable with or only able to contribute to your project through volunteering. People who have a desire to help by giving their time are invaluable assets to your income generation journey. Not only can they be called upon to perform labour-intensive tasks for your project, they are likely to be passionate about your project and are likely to spread the word, achieving a personal outreach that far exceeds traditional methods.</div>
        <p>The Volunteers module is where you can manage your relationships with your network of volunteers, so you always have people to call upon to help you communicate your project needs to the wider community.</p>
        <p>In the Volunteers module, you can search across your volunteers for those who are willing to do help out and for how much time they have pledged. For example, if you want people to hand out flyers for a particular project or to assist in other ways with the project, the Volunteers module will show you who is available for you to call upon.</p>
        <p>You can build your volunteer network the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>By running Campaign Messages.</li>
            <li>Through your Joinos Community page where people can register an interest in volunteering to help you.</li>
            <li>Word-of-mouth requests via other volunteers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <span class="Name">Volunteering</span> module links to the <span class="Name"><MadCap:variable name="ArroModules.Campaigns" /></span> module.</p>
        <h2>How do I build a volunteer network?</h2>
        <p>When you first begin to use this module it will be empty and you need to build your volunteer network. You can build your network by creating a campaign to contact your existing stakeholders in <MadCap:variable name="ArroModules.Campaigns" /> to invite them to volunteer to support your projects and by <a href="#AddingManually">adding volunteers manually</a>.</p>
        <p><b>Important!</b> If you are adding volunteers who are going to work with children or adults, you need to ensure that the volunteer has passed the relevant <a href="https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/dbs-barred-lists" target="_blank">DBS (previously CRB) checks</a>. You will need to check this information outside Arro software in the usual way.</p>
        <h3>Running a campaign the first time</h3>

        <h2>Managing your volunteers</h2>
