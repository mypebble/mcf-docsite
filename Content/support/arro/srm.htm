        <div class="quotation">The Importance of Stakeholder Relationships<br />Income may be received through your stakeholder relationships. In order to maximise the engagement and contributions from your stakeholders, you need to understand and profile the different types of relationships you have with them.  You will have stakeholders to whom you are accountable. In other words you will be expected to contribute towards these bodies’ aims. You will have other stakeholders with whom you conduct transactions i.e. you will provide goods or services and in return they will give you cash, equipment, resources, facilities or materials. Finally you will have stakeholders who are looking for a deeper level of engagement and participation in your school than simply giving you money. These are known as developmental stakeholders who will want to be involved in the planning and delivery of your projects and activities.</div>
        <p>The <span class="Name">SRM</span> module is where you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Manage your stakeholder details, including whether they are eligible for Gift Aid and are interested in volunteering to help you out.</li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Recording <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="PebbleGlossary.Term66">stakeholders</MadCap:glossaryTerm> as registered for Gift Aid is a legal requirement for <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="PebbleGlossary.Term32">HMRC</MadCap:glossaryTerm> audit purposes. We recommend that you print the declaration forms, issue them, retrieve the signed forms and file them in a safe place to comply with legislation.</p>
            <li>Create and view any marketing campaigns you have sent to stakeholders for your projects.</li>

        <h2><a name="Create"></a>Create a stakeholder</h2>
        <p>Stakeholders are set up here in the <span class="Name">SRM</span> module, but you can also add a stakeholder through the <span class="Name">Donations</span> module by clicking on <span class="Name">+ Add Name</span> when you record a donation, or <span class="Name">+ Add New</span> when you view donations. If you have a lot of stakeholders you want to add as a batch, you can import stakeholders from a csv file, provided it is set up correctly. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="#Import">Import Data</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open <span class="Name">SRM</span>.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Name">+ Add New</span>.</li>
            <li>Select the stakeholder profile from the <span class="Name">What profile type is this contact?</span> drop-down list.</li>
            <p>The stakeholder can be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pupil</li>
                <li>Family</li>
                <li>
                    <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="PebbleGlossary.Term0">Alumni</MadCap:glossaryTerm>
                </li>
                <li>Staff</li>
                <li>Person</li>
                <li>Business</li>
                <li>Community Organisation</li>
                <li>Charity</li>
                <li>Person</li>
                <li>Organisation</li>
                <li>User</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The stakeholder profile type gives an indication of whether they are eligible for Gift Aid or to be a volunteer for your school. For example, a pupil will not be eligible for Gift Aid, as Gift Aid donors are UK taxpayers. However you may link to the Pupil for your records but enter the parent’s name as the Gift Aid donor.</p>
            <p>An alumni or person profile type may or may not be eligible for Gift Aid. This depends on whether or not they are retired and if they are, whether they still pay tax. For example, if a retired person has savings and pays Income or Capital Gains Tax of an equal or higher amount than that being claimed (25p in the pound), then they are eligible for Gift Aid.</p>
            <p>If the profile type is Staff, they will probably not volunteer to help in the school as they are already a paid employee of the school.</p>

        <h2>Setting up a Gift Aid donor</h2>
        <p>Gift Aid donors are UK taxpayers. If the donor is not a UK taxpayer, they are not eligible to give Gift Aid. This means that if your stakeholder is a pupil or a charity they are not eligible to give Gift Aid.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add a stakeholder as described in <MadCap:xref href="#Create">Create a stakeholder</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Ensure that you click <span class="Name">Add Gift Aid/Volunteer Status</span>, select the check box <span class="Name">This contact is eligible for Gift Aid</span> and enter the donor’s <span class="Name">Title</span>, <span class="Name">Donor First Name</span> and <span class="Name">Donor Last Name</span>.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Name">Create</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">You should not submit a claim to collect Gift Aid on a donation until you have received the completed declaration form back from the donor.</p>
        <h3>Download the Gift Aid declaration form</h3>

            <li>Click <span class="Name">Template</span> to download the Gift Aid declaration form.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Send it to the stakeholder in the way they prefer to be contacted - Letter, Email, or Text to Mobile. If they have not stated a preference, send it using the method most likely to give a quick return. If they haven’t got an email address or a mobile phone number you will have to send it in the post.</p>
        <p>Once you receive the signed form, ensure that you file it in a safe place as this is required for HMRC auditing purposes.</p>
        <h2>Amend a stakeholder</h2>
        <p>You can amend any of the details for a stakeholder, for example, if they change address or become a volunteer or cease being eligible for Gift Aid.</p>

        <h2>Marking stakeholders as in or out of use</h2>
        <p>By default when you create a stakeholder, the stakeholder is in use.  You can mark a stakeholder as out of use or back in use. This means that you can create and hold a full list of stakeholders even if people are occasionally not available to help you.</p>

        <h2><a name="Import"></a>Import Data</h2>
        <p>If you have a lot of stakeholders to set up you can do this in one go by importing the stakeholder information from a CSV&#160;(comma separated values) file provided you set it up correctly.</p>
        <p>You can create a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with the extension .csv to hold the information you want to import. The first line in the file must be the header which specifies the fields you intend to import. Then each stakeholder information you want to import must be entered on a new line.</p>
        <p>If you want to create a file of your own, you can do this by downloading the template from within the <span class="Name">SRM</span> module.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Records are assigned unique identifier numbers (IDs) in the import file. All records with unique IDs are appended to the existing list of stakeholders within SRM. If the ID in the import file is not unique and matches one already in SRM, then the existing record in SRM is overwritten. You can see the unique ID of existing records by <a href="#Export">exporting the stakeholder list</a>.</p>

            <li>Enter the details of the stakeholders you want to import.</li>
            <p>Remember the information is entered for one stakeholder on one line, then the information for the next stakeholder on a new line and so on, until you have entered information for all of the stakeholders.</p>
            <p>e.g.</p>
            <p>Header</p>
            <p>Stakeholder 1 information</p>

        <h2><a name="campaigns"></a>Campaigns</h2>
        <p>Campaigns help you to maximise your engagement with your stakeholders. You can run different campaigns to help you recruit volunteers, to generate excitement about your project or to promote your project to receive donations. The number of emails sent during a campaign depends on the campaign you select. Our continuous research evaluates the best times to send emails to stakeholders within the different campaigns. For example, the campaign <i>Tell Your Story</i> will send five emails over five weeks to your stakeholders. This campaign is included as an example below.</p>
