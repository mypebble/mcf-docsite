        <p>Arro provides notifications of things which are of interest to you, for example, when new grants become available. The notifications window is accessed by clicking on the bell icon next to your login name at the top of the screen.<img src="Images/notifications icon.png" style="width: 30px;height: 33px;" /></p>
        <p>When a new notification becomes available, Arro alerts you to this by showing a number in red of the new notifications that have appeared. For example, if you receive one new alert for new grants, you would see Alerts of notifications. You receive notifications in Arro from the bell icon next to your logon name at the top of the screen.<img src="Images/new alert.png" style="width: 35px;height: 35px;" /></p>
        <p>To view the notifications in the <span class="Name">Notifications</span> window, click the notifications icon.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>To go to the relevant module in Arro, click on the notification, for example, to see new grants, click on the notification <span class="Name">New grants are available ...</span></p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">You may receive notifications at any time, so be alert to the number in red appearing and you can then check what these are. If you are not logged onto Arro, you will receive an email notification when there is a new alert within Arro.</p>
