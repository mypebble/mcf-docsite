        <div class="quotation">Donating through the Joinos Web Page<br />Altruism is a means of feeling good about yourself and at the same time knowing you are helping to make a difference to a worthy cause. In addition, the UK government rewards the altruism of donation by providing relief on the tax paid on donations to charities from UK taxpayers, thereby increasing the revenue to the charity by 25%. This costs ordinary rate taxpayers nothing. Higher rate taxpayers receive tax refunds of the difference between the rate they pay and the basic rate on the donation. Gift Aid is a win-win situation.</div>
