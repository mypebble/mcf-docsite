        <h1>Welcome To Fund Manager</h1>
        <p>There are many advantages to Fund Manager and all of them designed to save you time. Your dashboard provides a quick overview of all transactions.</p>
        <p>Multiple users can operate the system simultaneously. Reports of monies paid for dinners, school trips, uniform and other items are easily produced. Save time importing transactions directly from your online payments provider. A dynamic link from your schools’ MIS ensures all relevant pupil information can be swiftly imported.</p>
        <p>Fund Manager is cloud-hosted and removes any issues of permissions and policies. Our excellent security standards ensure you are in control of your data at all times.</p>
        <h2>Dashboard</h2>
        <p>The Dashboard has been designed with a report function, showing a quick overview of your accounts and as a shortcut to the most frequently used menu options.   You can navigate through the application by using the tabs at the top of the screen or by clicking on the quick link buttons.</p>
