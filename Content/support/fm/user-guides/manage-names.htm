        <h1>Managing Names</h1>
        <p>Pupil Names will usually be imported from your Administration database, most likely using MISapp (automatically on a daily basis) or via a one-off import from Sims.net or other Management databases.  This will be done as part of the setup process by Pebble Support.</p>
        <p>Each <span class="Name">Pupil</span> has their own entry within Fund Manager so you can register individual transactions against them.  More options are available such as <span class="Name">Staff</span>, <span class="Name">Contact </span>details and <span class="Name">Groups</span>.  Other names, including organisations, parents etc., can be added as required using the <span class="Name">Manage Names </span>Option.</p>
        <p>In <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Names</span>, use the filter box at the top of the Manage Names screen to find quickly the Name/Group/Year/Class etc. you are looking for.</p>

        </p>
        <h4>Batch Actions</h4>
        <p>The options in these sections can be applied to more than one name at a time.</p>
        <p>Once a name is no longer required you can mark it Out of Use.  Tick the box next to the name and then tick the Radio Button &gt; Out of Use.  You can return a name to ‘in use’ by simply clicking  on &gt; <img src="../../Images/FM Manage Names 02.png" /></p>
        <p>You will now see ‘out of use’ names; they will appear in grey, tick next to the name(s) and tick the Radio Button &gt; In Use in Batch Actions.  Refresh the page by clicking on Administration &gt; Manage Names for the Name(s) to be returned to ‘In Use’.</p>
        <h4>Group Actions</h4>
        <p>You can create a Group either by Year, Class, Registration or User Defined.  Groups are then used with the filter options throughout the application to quickly select a number of names to add transactions or create reports.   You can assign a Name to any number of Groups.  This is very useful for the Who’s Not Paid Report.</p>
        <h4><a name="NewGroup"></a>To Create a New Group</h4>

            <img src="../../Images/FM Manage Names 03.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Enter a Name  &gt;  Choose the Group Type  &gt;  Usually User Defined for ad-hoc Groups</p>
        <p>Click  &gt;  Add Group</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FM Manage Names 04.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You now need to choose the pupils to add to the Group, simply work your way through the names list by filtering or scrolling, ticking the box to the left of the name of the pupils you would like to add to the Group.</p>
        <p>Go back to  &gt;  Groups Actions  – at the bottom of the screen</p>
        <p>Choose &gt;  Your new Group from the drop down box (initially it will have defaulted to the bottom of the list)</p>
        <p>Click &gt; Add to Group</p>
        <p>Now each time you filter for that Group all the pupils in that Group will appear for you to choose from.</p>
        <p>Create New Name and Import Names</p>

        </p>
        <p>We would always suggest that you Import your pupil names from your administration database, this should avoid duplication.  The *MISAPP feature  is the automatic way to add an up to date file of pupil names with their year and registration group details and import them quickly into Fund Manager more help and information on this can be found by contacting the Support  Team.</p>
        <p>Pupil names can be added on an ad-hoc basis using the Create New Name tab at the top or bottom of the page.  You can add additional names for organisations, parents and staff.  Individual names, organisations, parents and staff are needed in Fund Manager to correctly identify their transactions.</p>
        <p>Choose the entry (Create New Pupil or Create New Organisation) and enter the correct Title/Name and complete the fields below with any additional information you require.</p>
