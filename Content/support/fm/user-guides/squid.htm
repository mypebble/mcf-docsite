        <h1>Using sQuid with Fund Manager</h1>
        <p>sQuid is an e-Payment system which allows Parents/Carers to pay for items using an online portal.  This is linked directly to Fund Manager and provides one simple account that links to their child’s school and which allows them to stay up-to-date via computer or on their mobile phone, make payments online, view their transactions and balances, receive and return permission slips and other documents.</p>
        <p>It’s simple, convenient, and it’s completely free for all parents.</p>
        <p>This document will cover the processes for Setting up, Posting and Amending Offers, as well as helping you to resolve common queries from parents.</p>
        <p>Please ensure the students are setup with sQuid, and have both the Meals and the Trip purses assigned to them. This will enable them to see any offers that are posted.</p>
        <p>This document comprises -</p>

        </p>
        <h2><a name="1"></a>1.     Ensuring students are setup correctly</h2>
        <p>Each pupil will have a SRN (sQuid Registration Number) and a CVV ( Card Verification Value). This information is provided by sQuid and is needed before registering.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FM sQuid 02.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The students details can be viewed by going to <span class="Name">sQuid &gt; Register Pupils &gt; Manual Registration</span>.</p>
        <p>The other tabs available within <span class="Name">sQuid &gt; Register Pupils</span> are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Name">Register Names With sQuid</span> - You can register students here who are not already setup on sQuid - If you are an <span class="Emphasis">IMPACT</span> school and receive your card numbers from a catering company, please ensure you speak to us about your file before attempting to Register these pupils.  To Register a pupil, Find the name to register, click on the small square to the left of the name (you can select multiple names) then click the <span class="Name">Register Names</span> button. This is automatically sent to Squid to process and when they have completed this, the name(s) will appear in the View Registered Names tab.</li>
            <li><span class="Name">View Registered Names</span> - You can use the tab to see who is registered with sQuid. It will also show ALL cards registered to that child (old/lost/expired etc.) Fund Manager, however, will know which card is linked to sQuid and use the correct number. These are NOT duplications in the system. Remember to ensure that the card has the correct purses added.  When the new intake of pupils is registered you can then print out all their registration letters at one go.  Select the year group and click <span class="Name">Search &gt; Print Registration Letters</span>.</li>
            <li>Manual Registration - If you require to add/amend a pupils sQuid information manually, you can use this screen to do that. Simply Search for and select the pupils name (in blue) and it will allow you to edit the card details.</li>
        </ul>

            <p>When an offer amount is set to “Unspecified” the amount will be greyed out, after being entered.  The parent(s) will be able to see the FULL amount on sQuid. Once they start paying the installments towards the trip, the value will reduce until they reach £0.00.</p>
            <p>If you wish the parents to pay a Minimum installment amount you will need to specify this in the Optional Description field.</p>

        <h2><a name="3"></a>3.    Importing sQuid sales</h2>
        <p>After the offers have been posted and parents start to pay, you will use the screen below to import the transactions for the students/user account.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FM sQuid 08.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select the Settlement Account for the money to be imported into</li>
            <li>Tick any transactions to be imported</li>
            <li>	Select ‘Import’</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once imported, your transactions will show in Fund Manager against the correct user accounts and names. The money will be added to the sQuid Settlement Account.</p>
        <h2><a name="4"></a>4. How do I transfer my sQuid payments to Reconcile?</h2>
        <p>Within Fund Manager, you are required to have a sQuid Settlement Account that all of the money is imported into (via the <span class="state">sQuid &gt; Import sQuid Sales</span>).</p>
        <p>You will not reconcile the Settlement Account, what you must do is transfer the NET of the transactions into your desired bank account (i.e. CURR - Current Account) to do this click <span class="Name">Bank &amp; Cash &gt; Transfer Between Bank Accounts</span>.</p>
        <p>To summarize:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>	Transfer From: sQuid Settlement Account*</li>
            <li>Transfer To: Your desired bank account to reconcile</li>
            <li>Amount</li>
            <li>Date</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FM sQuid 09.png" />
        </p>
        <h2><a name="5"></a>5	How to Record Bank Charges</h2>
        <p>After the transfer(s) are complete, you must now record any ‘bank charges’ back into the Settlement Account.  To do this, you must have a user account setup labeled (sQuid Bank Charges).  To do this please refer to <MadCap:xref href="manage-accounts.htm">Managing Accounts</MadCap:xref>. Please ensure you have a name that reflects this, the document for this is <a href="../faqs/new-name-transaction.htm">here</a> - <span class="Emphasis">Very important</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FM sQuid 10.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You must record a Payment (Direct Debit) back against the sQuid Settlement Bank account for the amount needed. This will reduce the Settlement Bank account to now include your charges.</p>
