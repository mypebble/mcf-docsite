        <h1>VAT Option</h1>
        <p>We have listened to your requests and now added the ability to record transactions, both receipts and payments with the associated amount of VAT.</p>
        <p>You can generate reports of these transactions in the Search Transactions and Search Account Balances reports. VAT100 reports do not affect Period End at all.</p>
        <p>You can also generate a VAT 100 report that displays all the relevant fields for your HMRC return.</p>
        <h4>Transactions and VAT</h4>
        <p>You will notice the addition of a new field on the ’Enter a Receipt’ and ‘Record a Payment’ screens.  This is the VAT code field and has a drop down function to list all the possible VAT categories.</p>
        <p>Always enter the GROSS amount of the transaction.  Select the appropriate VAT Code.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>We will maintain the VAT rates with the exception of the Custom rate, which will reveal a second field into which you can type the percentage.</p>
        <p>The rates provided are as follows-:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(S)tandard - 20%</li>
            <li>(R)educed - 5%</li>
            <li>(Z)ero - 0%</li>
            <li>(E)xcluded - 0%</li>
            <li>(O)ut of Scope - 0%</li>
            <li>(C)ustom - user defined value  with an additional field to enter the % rate</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Reports and VAT</h4>
        <p>You can include VAT in the Search Account Balances Report.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FM VAT 02.png" />
        </p>
        <p>To generate a VAT 100 report, go to Bank &amp; Cash &gt; Generate VAT100 report.</p>
        <p>Set an end date for the report, this is likely to be the end of your VAT reporting period. Fund Manager will total up all VAT transactions since the last report, including any that weren't included on a previous VAT100 report.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FM VAT 03.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The VAT100 report displays the 9 boxes that you are required to fill when completing the HMRC VAT return. The boxes that appear in blue text on the report can be clicked on to get a breakdown of evidence for that box; should the Inland Revenue ask for it.</p>
        <p>You can view previous VAT100 reports, by selecting them from a list, the display is the same as before.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h4>Refunds of VAT from HMRC</h4>
        <p>You can choose to record actual VAT refunded by HMRC as a direct credit into Fund Manager. If you set up a separate VAT user account to keep track of this it will make it easier to note if you have recovered/paid all the VAT liability for a period.</p>
        <p>It is not advised that you transfer these amounts into the individual accounts because it will affect the figures provided by the ‘Include VAT’ checkbox on the Search Account Balances report.</p>
        <p>Amending and Cancelling and VAT</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have paid a transaction into the bank, or reconciled a direct credit/debit, you cannot amend it, even to just apply VAT. This is awaiting development and will be available in a future release.</li>
            <li>You can cancel a transaction in the usual way and then re-enter as appropriate.</li>
            <li>You cannot amend a VAT transaction after you have included it in a VAT100 report.</li>
            <li>The above also apply to cancelling transactions.</li>
            <li>VAT100 reports cannot be cancelled or amended. This is awaiting development and will be available in a future release.</li>
        </ul>
