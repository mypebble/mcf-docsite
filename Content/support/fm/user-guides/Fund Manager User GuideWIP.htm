        <h1>Fund Manager User Guide</h1>
        <p>These are the main stages of the set-up of your Fund Manager. We have designed the process to be simple and straightforward.</p>
        <p>Once we have received your order for Fund Manager, we will create your organisation/school and send you a welcome email. Click the link in the email and use your email address to login. You will have to create a password which must be a minimum of 8 characters and contain one number, one capital letter and one special character.</p>
        <p>Each member of your team can have their own unique login for Fund Manager. We will require the name and email address for each user. They will receive their own email to create their login and password.</p>
        <p>If we at Pebble are handling your set-up we will also send documents to help you get the correct financial information, pupil Names and other details to us.</p>
        <p>We will then arrange a time with you to complete inputting your financial data and will give you a short training course on the main functions of Fund Manager to get you going.</p>
        <p>Once your set-up is complete your one hour remote training session will be scheduled at your convenience.</p>
        <p>This would be a good time to confirm you are using a recommended browser. See <MadCap:xref href="Configuring-Browsers.htm">Configuring Browsers</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h1>First steps</h1>
        <p>First of all you need to login. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <a href="http://www.mypebble.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.mypebble.co.uk</a>, click on <span class="Name">Fund Manager</span> and then click on <span class="Name">Login</span>.</li>
            <li>Login using your email and password from your welcome email.</li>
            <p> The first screen you will see is the <span class="Name">Dashboard</span>.</p>
        </ol>
        <h1>Dashboard</h1>
        <p>The Dashboard has been designed with a report function, showing a quick overview of your accounts and as a shortcut to the most frequently used menu options. You can navigate through the application by using the tabs at the top of the screen or by clicking on the quick link buttons.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMUG01.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Each section has a specific purpose. </p>
        <p>The <span class="Name">Transactions</span> area identifies your Opening balance as well as Transfers in and out, Receipts, Payments and the Balance of your Accounts.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Name">Bank and Cash</span> area identifies your Cash and Cheques in Hand, your Bank Accounts and their Balances.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Name">Reports</span> area is not yet active but will show a graphical display of your income and expenditure once activated.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Name">Organisation Summary</span> displays the number of Accounts, Names, Transactions and Days in the Financial Period.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Name">Tabs</span> at the top of the screen are the way in which you navigate to the different areas of the application. Each Tab reveals a list of menu items.</p>
        <h1>Administration</h1>
        <h2>Manage Names</h2>
        <p>Pupil names will most probably be imported from your administration database. This will be done as part of the set-up process by one of the Pebble Support team. Each pupil has their own entry within Fund Manager so you can register individual transactions against them. Other names such as organisations, parents and staff will be added as required using the Manage Names option.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select <span class="Name">Administration &gt;&#160;Manage Names</span>.</li>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Images/FMUG02.png" />
            </p>
            <li>Use the filter box at the top of the <span class="Name">Manage Names</span> screen to find quickly the Name/Group/Year/Class etc you are looking for.</li>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Images/FMUG03.png" />
            </p>
        </ol>
        <h3>Batch Actions</h3>
        <p>The options in these sections can be applied to more than one name at a time.</p>
        <p>Once a name is no longer required you can mark it <span class="Name">Out of Use</span>.  Tick the box next to the name and then tick the radio button  <span class="Name">Out of Use</span>.  You can return a name to ‘in use’ by simply clicking  on <img src="../../Images/FMUG04.png" style="width: 98px;height: 25px;" /></p>
        <p>You will now see ‘out of use’ names; they will appear in grey, tick next to the name(s) and tick the radio button <span class="Name">In Use</span> in Batch Actions.  Refresh the page by clicking on <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Names</span> for the Name(s) to be returned to <span class="Name">In Use</span>.</p>
        <h3>Group Actions</h3>
        <p>You can create a Group either by Year, Class, Registration or User Defined.  Groups are then used with the filter options throughout the application to quickly select a number of names to add transactions or create reports.   You can assign a Name to any number of Groups.</p>
        <h4>To create a new group</h4>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMUG05.png" />
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click Create Group.</li>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Images/FMUG06.png" />
            </p>
            <li>Enter a <span class="Name">Name</span>.</li>
            <li>Choose the <span class="Name">Group Type</span> - this is normally <span class="Name">User Defined</span> for ad-hoc groups.</li>
            <li>Click   <span class="Name">Add Group</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To add pupils to the group</h4>
        <p>You now need to choose the pupils to add to the Group, simply work your way through the names list by filtering or scrolling, ticking the box to the left of the name of the pupils you would like to add to the Group.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go back to  <span class="Name">Group Actions</span> at the foot of the <span class="Name">Manage Names</span> screen</li>
            <li>Choose your new group from the drop down list (initially it will have defaulted to the bottom of the list).</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Name">Add to Group</span>. </li>
            <p>Now each time you filter for that Group all the pupils in that Group will appear for you to choose from.</p>
        </ol>
        <h4>To create new names and import names</h4>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMUG07.png" />
        </p>
        <p>We would always suggest that you Import your pupil names from your administration database, this should avoid duplication.  The *MISAPP feature  is the automatic way to add an up to date file of pupil names with their year and registration group details and import them quickly into Fund Manager more help and information on this can be found by contacting the Support  Team.</p>
        <p>Pupil names can be added on an ad-hoc basis using the <span class="Name">Create New Pupil</span> tab at the top or bottom of the page.  You can add additional names for organisations, parents and staff.  Individual names, organisations, parents and staff are needed in Fund Manager to correctly identify their transactions.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose the entry (<span class="Name">Create New Pupil</span> or <span class="Name">Create New Organisation</span>) and enter the correct Title/Name and complete the fields below with any additional information you require.</li>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Images/FMUG08.png" />
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="Name">In Use</span> means the entry is on roll and In Use.</li>
                <li><span class="Name">Gift Aid Donor</span> If a parent or other adult is a tax payer you can add that detail by highlighting the name and ticking the Gift Aid Donor box.  This will allow you to search on all donations made by GIFT AID donors.  The details can be used to complete the tax refund form for Registered Charities.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you have filled in all the information you require click on <span class="Name">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Manage Accounts</h2>
        <p>All the functions for setting up <span class="Name">Accounts</span> in Fund Manager are on the <span class="Name">Administration</span> Tab and the details of some accounts may have been added during your Set Up.  Other Accounts can be added as and when required.</p>
        <p>There are three sections, <span class="Name">Manage Account</span>, <span class="Name">Manage Bank Accounts</span> and <span class="Name">Manage Ledger Codes</span>.</p>
        <p>An <span class="Name">Account</span> is equivalent to an individual column header in a manual ledger. Accounts can be created at any time.  There is no effective limit to the number of Accounts you may have, but each one must have its own unique Code.</p>
        <p>The Account Code is a combination of between 1 and 6 letters and numbers.  Once saved, a code and an account name can be edited but can never be deleted; Instead Accounts are taken ‘Out of Use’ when you have no further need of them.  This prevents them from appearing on the transaction screens.  They may continue to appear on the report screens if they have a balance which is relevant to the open financial period.</p>
        <p>A <span class="Name">Bank Account</span> can be any account held with a bank that is used for the purposes of managing your Fund, eg current account, Savings accounts etc.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Name">Ledger Codes</span> option is available for providing exports into other finance packages to allow you to continue providing unified reports (eg VAT reporting), whilst gaining the benefits of Fund Manager's superior transaction entry.  Ledger codes are numbers you can assign to different debit and credit entries to make accounting easier (e.g. grouping all trip transactions etc).</p>
        <h4>To view and edit your Accounts</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>On the <span class="Name">Dashboard</span> (Organisation Summary), select  <span class="Name">Accounts</span>.</li>
            <p>OR</p>
            <p>Go to <span class="Name">Administration &gt;&#160;Manage Accounts</span>.</p>
            <p>Here you will see all the Accounts that have been set up in your Fund Manager.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Images/FMUG09.png" />
            </p>
            <li>By clicking on any of the Account Names you can then edit the Account details, mark it ‘Out of Use’, Share Balances (with Joinos), Create and Assign to a Group, Assign or change an Opening Balance, Budget and Unit Cost.  The Unit Cost needs to be recorded if you would like to use the ‘Who’s Not Paid’ Report in the reporting section <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Versions.Exclude">(INSERT see section on Reporting)</MadCap:conditionalText>.</li>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Images/FMUG16.png" />
            </p>
            <li>You can view or amend your <span class="Name">Opening Balance</span> here. This is the amount of money the account owned or owed on the date on which the account was created.</li>
            <li>You may add details of the <span class="Name">Budget</span> value. A negative Budget value indicates an expected level of expenditure or loss.  A positive Budget value indicates an expected level of income or profit.  This might be useful for budget holders to know their budget position by simply looking in Fund Manager for the funds that remain available.</li>
            <li>You may add a <span class="Name">Unit Cost</span> if appropriate for a trip or activity account. You can enter the cost per head of this trip or activity. This information will be included in the Who’s Not Paid Report and used to calculate an outstanding balance. If you do not use a unit cost then the Who’s Not Paid Report in the Report tab will not generate any details for you to view.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="Name">Save</span> or <span class="Name">Abandon</span> to go back to the Manage Accounts screen.</p>

            <img src="../../Images/FMUG10.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You will now see archived Accounts – they will appear in grey, tick next to the Account and tick the radio button <span class="Name"> In Use</span> in the Batch Actions section. Click the <span class="Name">Update Account(s)</span> button for the Account to be In Use again.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMUG11.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Then click the <span class="Name">Hide out of use</span> button again to return.</p>

        <p>You can create a Group for your Accounts, e.g. Trips, off site, overseas, 6th form etc.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMUG12.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Groups are then used with the filter options throughout the application to quickly create reports.  The Accounts in the Group will be reported individually and with a subtotal.</p>
        <p>Create your Group first and then click the Accounts you want to be added to that Group.  Accounts can be quickly added or removed from groups.  Once an Account has been added to a group you will see the details in the group’s column beside the account names.  You can have multiple groups against each name.</p>
        <p>When you see the accounts list throughout the application, it will be presented in account code order.  Numbers then letters, alphabetically.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">If you need a new Group you can create one in the same way as you can in Manage Names, from the bottom of the Manage Accounts screen.</p>

        <p>The Opening Balances of your Accounts will usually have been entered by one of the Pebble Support team when you first begin using Fund Manager.  If you create additional Bank Accounts you can set up the Opening Balance in the Manage Bank Accounts tab (above).  These will also be the Opening Balances for the new financial year following a Period End Closedown.</p>

        <h4>Period End Closedown</h4>
        <p>You will need to close down your Fund Manager at some point after your Period End.</p>
        <p>Once the end date for your financial period has passed you can perform a Period End Closedown in Fund Manager that will draw a line under your transactions and allow you to produce the necessary reports to submit to your auditor.</p>
        <p>The objective of a closedown is to:</p>
        <p>1.       Draw a line under your transactions for the period</p>
        <p>2.   	Close any accounts that will not be used in the next period</p>
        <p>3.   	Determine which accounts will have their balances transferred to the new period</p>
        <p>4.       Balance your income and expenditure for the period with that of your bank</p>
        <p>During the Period End Closedown, Fund Manager will automatically carry forward your account closing balances and present them as the opening balances in the next period</p>
        <p>Once you select 'Confirm' your system is locked down into a draft close down, this is not fully closed and may be undone at any time. However, your transactions are moved into an archive state. Once your auditors have fully agreed and signed off your paper work, you may then close down your system completely.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: "> You are still able to enter transaction in your current financial year while this close down is occurring.</p>
        <p>Once you have confirmed your Period End Closedown all transactions within the closed period date range are completely locked and you will be no longer able to amend any transactions in the closed period or roll back to an unclosed date.</p>
        <p>Before you start to do your Closedown, there is some preparation to do:</p>

                <p>The ‘Out of Use’ accounts appear greyed out on this report.</p>
                <p>Now you can see all the Accounts each with their closing Balance (column on the extreme right).</p>
                <p>You can verify here if:</p>

                    <li> 	the account will be used in the next financial period</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For those accounts that are not to be used in the next period AND have a balance of zero you just need to confirm they have been marked ‘Out of Use’, (greyed out on this report).</p>

                    <li>Click Update Account(s) button (note the accounts will become greyed out).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you want an Account balance to be something other than the closing balance on the report you will need to make an Account Transfer.</p>
                <p>To clear a balance to zero, transfer money out of the Account, to increase the balance transfer money in.  You can create a temporary holding Account for these Transfers to go into until you have determined the appropriate accounts to be used;</p>

        <h4>To create a draft period end closedown</h4>
        <p>You will need to create a Draft Period End Closedown which will generate all the Reports required for a financial period.</p>
        <p>This includes :-</p>
        <ul>
            <li>        	Accounts Summary Income and Expenditure Report</li>
            <li>        	Transactions Report</li>
            <li>Account Balances</li>

            <li>Cash History</li>
            <li>Closing Bank Balances</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These reports will be available at all times on the Period End Closedown menu option. Once you have created the draft closedown the system locks all the transactions within that time period until you either confirm the closedown after it has been approved, or cancel the draft period end closedown.</p>

        <h1>Transactions</h1>
        <p>Firstly a quick overview of what is required to enter Transactions and move money through the program.</p>
        <p>Transactions are either;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Receipts - money is received or</li>
            <li>Payments - money is spent, paid out</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A Transaction comprises an Account, one or more Names, a Description, a Reference, an Amount and a Date, plus a Notes field.  In addition you can specify the type of money – Cash, Cheque or Direct Credit or ePayment.  As you enter Transactions Fund Manager maintains the Balance of your Accounts by posting the values you enter on both sides of the Balance sheet.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMUG31.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Enter a receipt</h2>
        <p>Receipt Transactions require 3 stages to be completed they are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Received</li>
            <li>Paid-In i.e. Banked  - (see <a href="#bankhistory">Bank History</a>) and then</li>
            <li>Reconciled with your Bank Statement </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Printing a single receipt can be done when all details have been entered.</p>
        <p>First you need to make sure you are in the green backed screen to Enter a Receipt;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMUG32.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the <span class="Name">Account</span> - Using the drop down option, or by typing the account code into the shorter of the two fields in the account section, choose the appropriate account for this receipt.</p>
        <p>Once an Account has been selected a second tab will appear on the top of the screen.</p>
        <p>View Transactions is a list of all Transactions that have been posted for that Account to date.</p>
        <h3>View Transactions</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMUG33.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You may view the transactions for a specific account once it has been selected for use in the receipt option.  This list is not definable but can be printed. You can define a transactions list from the Reports menu.</p>
        <h4>Add a Description</h4>
        <p>The text you enter here will appear on most Reports, this is the narrative you would usually use for this kind of transaction, something must be entered here.</p>
        <h4>Add a Reference – if required</h4>
        <p>Which if entered will also appear on some Reports and on the Bank reconciliation process.</p>
        <h4>Type of Receipt</h4>
        <p>Cash, Cheque etc.  by selecting from the drop down options.  If a Receipt Transaction enters your Bank Account directly it is a Direct Credit.  You will have to identify the Bank Account receiving the funds.  If it is not cash, you will need to choose a Bank Account.</p>
        <h4>Date</h4>
        <p>If the Default Date needs to be changed, use the calendar to select the appropriate date or overtype the entry in the field.</p>
        <h4>Amount</h4>
        <p>Enter the Amount of your single receipt.  If more than one pupil is paying the same amount to the same account with the same type of money (Cash/Cheque) you can select more than one name in the names section and bulk input.  Remember though to input cash and cheque receipts separately.</p>
        <h4>Receipt No</h4>
        <p>The application will generate a sequence beginning at whatever number you start at and continue to offer the next number available.  Receipt numbers are unique.</p>
        <h4>Name section</h4>
        <p>Then select one or more names by using the filter and ticking the box next to their name/s.</p>
        <p>If the name/s already exists you may select it from the list.  If not you can add a new name.   Click the Manage Names button to go to the Manage Names screen, add the additional Name/s, Save and then return to the Receipt screen to complete.</p>
        <p>If you want to select more than one name you can either click beside the names or set a filter to quickly restrict the names list to only those in a particular Year, Class or Group.</p>
        <p>Once you have a list of all names for this transaction - you will see the list grow in the white box on the right if you have chosen more than one name.  If there are more names on subsequent pages you will have to go to each page and repeat this action.  You can remove the tick in any name box once ticked if you make a mistake or remove the name from the list found to the right of the names section by clicking the X next to the appropriate name.</p>
        <p>You may Save, or Save + Print your transaction to any printer on A4 and/or to a specific receipt printer on thermal paper ‘tear off’ roll.  You can also Save + Send SMS if you have subscribed to this option.  Using Abandon will prevent any of the details entered from being saved.</p>
        <p>When Transactions are saved a summary of each one is displayed at the top of the screen.  You can close this display by clicking on the X in the top right corner.  If you enter another Receipt the display will close automatically.</p>
        <h2>Split Receipts/Payments</h2>
        <p>You can split a Receipt or Payment across any number of Accounts and a Receipt across any number of Names.</p>
        <p>When you have entered a Receipt by Cheque/Direct Credit or Recorded a Payment by Cheque/Direct Debit and saved the transaction you can split the amount by following the on screen prompts.</p>
        <p>From the yellow bar at the top of your screen there is the option to ‘split this Receipt/Payment’;</p>

        <h2>Record a payment</h2>
        <p>Payment Transactions require 2 stages to be completed they are;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>  	Paid-Out  - and then</li>
            <li>  	Reconciled with your Bank Statement </li>
        </ol>
        <p>A Transaction comprises an Account, a Name, a Description, a Reference, an Amount and a Date, plus a Notes field.  In addition you can specify the type of money – Cash, Cheque, Direct debit or ePayment.  As you enter transactions Fund Manager maintains the balance of your accounts by posting the values you enter on both sides of the balance sheet.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMUG35.png" />
        </p>
        <p>First you need to make sure you are in the red backed screen to Record a Payment;</p>
        <p>Select the <span class="Name">Account</span> - using the drop down option, or by typing the Account Code into the shorter of the two fields in the Account section.  This is the Account to be debited.</p>
        <p>Once an Account has been selected a second tab will appear on the top of the screen.  View Transactions is a list of all transactions that have been recorded for that account to date.</p>
        <h3>View Transactions</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMUG36.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You may view the Transactions (from the ‘View Transactions’ tab) for a specific Account once it has been selected for use in the Payment option.  This list is not definable, but can be printed. You can define a transactions list from the Reports menu.</p>
        <h4>Add a Description</h4>
        <p>The text you enter here will appear on most Reports, this is the narrative you would usually use for this kind of transaction.  For a Payment it will most likely be what the Payment is for, something needs to be entered here.</p>
        <h4>Add a Reference - optional</h4>
        <p>Which if entered will also appear on some Reports and on the Bank reconciliation process.  This might be an invoice number or Reference from a Bank Statement.</p>
        <h4>Type of Receipt</h4>
        <p>Cash, Cheque etc.  by selecting from the drop down options.  If a Payment Transaction Debits your Bank Account Directly it is a Direct Debit.  You will have to identify the Bank Account paying out the funds.  If it is not cash, you will have to identify the Bank Account.</p>
        <h4>Date</h4>
        <p>If the Default Date needs to be changed use the calendar to select the appropriate date or overtype the entry in the field.</p>
        <h4>Amount</h4>
        <p>Enter the Amount of your single Payment.  If more than one Payment is being paid i.e. by Cash for the same Amount from the same Account to different Names you can select more than one Name in the Names section and bulk input.</p>
        <h4>Cheque/Voucher No</h4>
        <p>The program will generate a sequence beginning at whatever number you start at and always offer the next number available.  Cheque and voucher numbers are unique.  For each bank account a unique number range for cheque and vouchers will be maintained.</p>
        <h4>Name section</h4>
        <p>Then select the Name of the organisation/staff/pupil etc.  you are paying.  If the Name already exists you may select it from the list.  If not you can add a new name.   Click on the Manage Names button to go to the Manage Names screen.  Create the Name and Save, then return to the Payments tab to complete the Payment.</p>
        <p>You might like to add the companies you pay to an ‘organisations’ Group in Manage Names.  This would be useful when you need to filter for suppliers.  You can Create a Group in the Manage Names or Manage Accounts screens.</p>
        <p>Once you have the Name of the organisation/staff/pupil etc.  you are paying, tick the box to the left of the Name and Save or Save + Print your Transaction.  You can also Save + Send SMS to the payee if you subscribe to this option.  Using Abandon will prevent any of the details entered from being saved.</p>
        <h4>Transfers Between Names/Accounts</h4>
        <p>This option will allow you to move money from one Account and one Name to another.  As this is not additional income or expenditure it is reported apart from true income and expenditure and appears in the columns Transfers In and Transfers Out on some reports.</p>
        <h3>Transfer between Accounts</h3>
        <p>From the Transactions tab:</p>

        <h2>Brought forward balances onto Fund Manager</h2>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">New to Fund Manager</span> - This is a useful tool when you would like to bring brought forward Balances from a previous version of School Fund Manager or another Accounting system onto your new Fund Manager to show who has paid for what previously  e.g. a trip.</p>
        <p>These Balances will be agreed with you when we set up your new Fund Manager and then you will be given instructions on how to transfer these balances to individual pupils during your training. You will then be able to report on these brought forward balances in Reports &gt; Who’s not Paid.</p>
        <h2>Cancel Receipt or Payment Transaction</h2>
        <p>Should a mistake be made, inadvertently we are sure, it is possible to correct it easily (and without drawing the attention of the rest of the world).  The Cancellation option enables corrections to be made in a controlled manner, which does not compromise the integrity of the system.</p>
        <p>From the Transactions tab&gt;Cancel Receipt or Payment Transaction</p>
        <p>You can Cancel a Receipt or Payment Transaction simply by finding or filtering for the transaction, ticking the box next to it on the left and clicking continue at the bottom.  You can cancel more than one transaction at a time.</p>

                <p>If you need to cancel a Bank Transaction that has been Reconciled, then you must Unreconcile it first.  There is an option on the Bank and Cash menu for this process.</p>
                <p>Unreconciling will simply return all the items that had been Reconciled back to the list of items NOT Reconciled.  To use this function simply tick the Statement you would like to Unreconcile on the left and click Unreconcile.</p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Unreconciling a Bank Statement will cause all subsequent reconciliations to be automatically unreconciled.</p>
