        <h1>Fund Manager User Guide</h1>
        <p>This guide covers the main stages of the set-up of your Fund Manager. We have designed the process to be simple and straightforward.</p>
        <p>Once we have received your order for Fund Manager, we will create your organisation/school and send you a welcome email. Click the link in the email and use your email address to login. You will have to create a password which must be a minimum of 8 characters and contain one number, one capital letter and one special character.</p>
        <p>Each member of your team can have their own unique login for Fund Manager. We will require the name and email address for each user. They will receive their own email to create their login and password.</p>
        <p>If we at Pebble are handling your set-up we will also send documents to help you get the correct financial information, pupil Names and other details to us.</p>
        <p>We will then arrange a time with you to complete inputting your financial data and will give you a short training course on the main functions of Fund Manager to get you going.</p>
        <p>Once your set-up is complete your one hour remote training session will be scheduled at your convenience.</p>
        <p>This would be a good time to confirm you are using a recommended browser. See <MadCap:xref href="browser-setup.htm">Configuring Browsers</MadCap:xref>.</p>
