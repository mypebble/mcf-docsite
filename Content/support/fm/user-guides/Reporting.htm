        <p>If you want to see all Transactions in your system, make no changes to the fields that are presented and click on the Search Button.</p>

        <p>There are no balances on the Search Transactions Report because the Search Transactions report is a list of Transactions within an Account which can be found in either Account Summary or Search Account Balances when you click on the Account Code.</p>
        <p>In the Search Transactions report the total of all the displayed transactions in the Summary bar is labelled ‘Total’.  This is because you have the option to filter the Transactions by multiple Accounts or numerous other options and therefore this would not be a ‘Balance’.</p>

        <h2>Pay Receipts to Bank</h2>
        <p>Fund Manager needs to know that you have paid your cheques and cash into the bank. To do this you need to complete a ‘New Paying-in Slip’ from the Bank and Cash tab&gt;Pay Receipts to Bank.</p>
        <p>You need to either choose all the Cheques to pay in by ticking the box next to the date or if necessary, filter for the Cheques you want to Pay in and tick the box next to these Cheques individually.  When a cheque has been selected the details will be added to the items selected box on the right of the screen.

        <h2>Draw Cheque for Cash</h2>
        <p>Fund Manager allows you to hold back Cash from Paying-in to the Bank to use for Petty Cash rather than Drawing a Cheque for this purpose.  As the Cash is recorded as Receipts and then as Payments you can use this Cash rather than withdrawing money from the Bank.  If however you wish to Draw a Cheque for Cash please do so by completing this screen to keep your Accounts in Balance.</p>
        <h2>Reconcile a Bank Statement</h2>
        <p>Once you receive your Bank Statement you will need to reconcile this to Fund Manager. From the Bank and Cash tab choose <span class="Name">Reconcile a Statement &gt; Choose Bank Account to Reconcile</span>;</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">We can arrange a short training session to help you complete a bank reconciliation for the first time if needed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FM Reporting 04.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Reconciliation is the process whereby you and the Bank agree the Transactions that have been entered and cleared on each Bank Account.  As soon as the Bank Statement/s arrives you should tick the items that match those on Fund Manager.  Transactions may remain Unreconciled for some time, especially if Cheques you have sent to someone fail to be presented for Cashing.  If an item is Reconciled incorrectly it can be Unreconciled.</p>
        <p>When Reconciliation is complete you can print out your Reconciliation from;</p>
        <p>Bank and Cash&gt;List Reconciled Statements</p>
        <p>Choose&gt;Click on the Date of Reconciliation to be printed</p>
        <p>Print the Report from the bottom of the screen</p>
        <p>You can take as many printouts as required of your Bank Statement Reconciliations.</p>
        <p>The Opening Balance on the List Unreconciled Bank Entries Report should always match the figure on the last Bank Statement you Reconciled.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">If you leave a bank reconciliation part way through, when you return to Bank reconciliation you will be returned to the part completed statement.  You MUST complete a reconciliation before you can proceed to another one, irrespective of how many bank accounts you have.</p>
        <h2>Transfer Between Bank Accounts</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FM Reporting 05.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Cancel/Amend a Bank Transaction</h2>
        <p>You can cancel Bank Transactions including Cashed Cheques, Paying in Slips and Bank Transfers, while they remain Unreconciled.  Reconciled items and items that are part of an incomplete bank reconciliation and that have been selected will not appear in the list.</p>
        <h2>Unreconcile Bank Statement</h2>
        <p>If you need to cancel a Bank Transaction that has been Reconciled, then you must Unreconcile it first.  There is an option on the Bank and Cash menu for this process.</p>

        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Unreconciling a Bank Statement will cause all subsequent reconciliations to be automatically unreconciled.</p>
