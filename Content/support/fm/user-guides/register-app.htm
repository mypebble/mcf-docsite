        <h1>Register App - Update Instructions</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue: </span>You will be required to update your Register App on occasions as we continue to develop new features and fix issues.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution:</span>  Before you start the update process please make sure you tablet is connected to your Wi-Fi or 3G.</p>
        <p>When you open the Register App you will arrive at the login screen. The app will automatically check against the Pebble server that you are running the latest version. In order that the check takes place make sure you have completely shut the Register App since your last time of use. You can do this by switching off the tablet and switch it back on again or by closing the app through the app management page on the tablet.</p>
        <p>If a new update is available you will see the following message: <i>A newer version of the program is available. Do you want to update?</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tap <span class="Name">Yes</span> to continue to a secondary message re-confirming the update.</li>
            <li>Tap <span class="Name">Ok</span> to continue.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">You will not experience a loss of data as the Register App directly sources all the data it uses from Fund Manager. After the update is done and you login to the updated Register App all your data will reappear.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Finally confirm the installation of the update by tapping the Install button at the bottom of final screen.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This will complete the update.</p>
        <p>Once completed you can now login to the Register App from the home screen and reload your group, account and pupil data.</p>
        <p>If the automatic update does not start on your tablet you can manually update the Register App by pressing the “Check for updates” button on the upload data screen.</p>
