        <h1>Period End Closedown</h1>
        <p>Once the end date for your financial period has passed you can perform a Period End Closedown in Fund Manager that will draw a line under your transactions and allow you to produce the necessary reports to submit to your auditor. Once you have confirmed your Period End Closedown, all transactions within the closed period will become locked.</p>
        <p>The objective of a closedown is to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Draw a line under your transactions for the period</li>
            <li>Close any accounts that will not be used in the next period</li>
            <li>Determine which accounts will have their balances transferred to the new period</li>
            <li>Balance your income and expenditure for the period with that of your bank</li>
        </ul>
        <p>During the Period End Closedown, Fund Manager will automatically carry forward your account closing balances and present them as the opening balances in the next period</p>
        <h2>Preparing for Period End</h2>
        <p>Before you can commence with your close down there is some preparation to be done:-</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Determine which accounts are to be closed</li>
            <li>Clear any closing balances which are not required in the next financial period</li>
            <li>Determine which accounts are to be retained with their balance in the next financial period</li>
            <li>Reconcile all bank accounts up to or beyond the close down date</li>
            <li>Print a list of cancelled transactions</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>1.    Determine which accounts are to be closed</h4>
        <p>Go to <span class="Name">Reports &gt; Search Account Balances</span> and make sure the box for ‘Include Out of Use’ is ticked, otherwise you may not see all of your accounts. The ‘Out of Use’ accounts appear greyed out on this report.</p>
        <p>Put the Period Dates into the date fields (you can see your period beginning date on the Dashboard).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FM Period End 01.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Now you can see all the Accounts each with their closing Balance (column on the extreme right).</p>
        <p>You can verify here if:-</p>
        <ul>
            <li>	the closing balances are correct for the start of your new financial period</li>
            <li>the account will be used in the next financial period</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For those accounts that are not to be used in the next period AND have a balance of zero you just need to confirm they have been marked ‘Out of Use’, (greyed out on this report).</p>
        <p>To take an account ‘Out of Use’</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Accounts</span></li>
            <li>Click on the box beside the account/s that you want to take Out of Use (note you can see the account balances here)</li>
            <li>Click in the Radio button beside ‘Out of Use’</li>
            <li>	Click Update Account/s button (note the accounts will become greyed out)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you want an account balance to be something other than the Balance on this report you will need to make an account transfer.</p>
        <p>In order to clear a balance to zero, transfer money out of the account, to increase the balance transfer money in.</p>
        <p>If the account has been marked ‘Out of Use’ you will have to bring it back into use before you can make a transfer.</p>
        <p>Not sure which account to use for these transfers? You can create a temporary holding account for these transfers until you have determined the appropriate accounts to be used;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Accounts</span></li>
            <li>Create New Account – create the new account with a code eg TEMP – End of Year Temporary Account</li>
            <li>Save</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>2.    Decide if you need to zero balances or leave them with a true reflection of what has transacted?</h4>
        <p>You have the opportunity now to decide whether to zero some or all of your account balances or leave these with a true reflection of what has transacted. If you would like to zero account balances you will need to transfer money between accounts.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <span class="Name">Transactions &gt; Transfer Money Between Accounts</span></li>
            <li>When transferring any balances please record all these account transfers with a date within the financial period you are closing</li>
            <li>If you are not in a position to know which account/s will be used in the transfers of balances, make use of the TEMP account mentioned above or something appropriate to your needs.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>3.    Determine which accounts are to be retained with their balance in the next financial period</h4>
        <p>Return to <span class="Name">Reports &gt; Search Account Balances</span> and make sure the box for ‘Include Out of Use’ is ticked, otherwise you may not see all of your accounts. The ‘Out of Use’ accounts appear greyed out on this report.</p>
        <p>Put the Period Dates into the date fields, (you can see your period beginning date on the Dashboard).</p>
        <p>You should check that all the accounts are listed with their balance that is to be retained in the new financial period and appear greyed out if they are no longer required.</p>
        <h4>4. Reconcile all Bank Accounts up to or beyond the close down date</h4>
        <p>All your bank accounts must be reconciled to or past your Period End Date.</p>
        <p>If you have a Savings Account or an Inactive account where the balance hasn’t changed since you have last reconciled it you must reconcile the bank account with an end date either on or after your close down date.</p>
        <p>You can do a bank reconciliation without any transactions. Please only do this if there has been no change in the account balance, otherwise please request a statement from you bank or wait until you receive your statement.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <span class="Name">Bank &amp; Cash &gt; Reconcile a Bank Statement</span></li>
            <li>	Select a Bank Account from the drop down list</li>
            <li>Click Reconcile This Account</li>
            <li>Enter the appropriate statement details with an end date ON or AFTER the close down date</li>
            <li>	Complete the reconciliation as usual by selecting the items which appear on the statement (or if reconciling a zero item statement then simply press Reconcile).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You must do this for ALL your bank accounts. You must complete one reconciliation before you can start another irrespective of how many bank accounts you have. Now you can proceed to create a Draft Period End report.</p>
        <h4>5.	Print a list of cancelled transactions</h4>
        <p>You will need to print a list of all your transactions that have been cancelled during the year.  This must be done before you proceed to Draft Period End Closedown.  They will not be available to print after this time.</p>
        <p>To do this click <span class="Name">Reports &gt; List of Cancellations &gt; Print</span></p>
        <h2>Draft Period End</h2>
        <p>You will need to process a Draft Period End which will generate all the reports required for a financial period. This includes :-</p>

        <p>Once you have created the draft closedown the system locks all the transactions within that time period until you either confirm the closedown after it has been approved, or cancel the draft period end closedown.</p>
        <p>To proceed to create a draft period end closedown go to <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Period End Closedown</span></p>
