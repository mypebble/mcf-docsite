        <h1>Transactions</h1>
        <p>Firstly a quick overview of what is required to enter Transactions and move money through the program.</p>
        <p>Transactions are either;</p>
        <p>Receipts - money is received or</p>
        <p>Payments - money is spent, paid out</p>
        <p>A Transaction comprises an Account, one or more Names, a Description, a Reference, an Amount and a Date, plus a Notes field.  In addition you can specify the type of money – Cash, Cheque or Direct Credit or ePayment.  As you enter Transactions Fund Manager maintains the Balance of your Accounts by posting the values you enter on both sides of the Balance sheet.</p>

        <h2>Enter a Receipt</h2>
        <p>Receipt Transactions require 3 stages to be completed they are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Received</li>
            <li>  	Paid-In i.e. Banked  - (see page 24) and then</li>
            <li>Reconciled with your Bank Statement – (see page 25)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Printing a single receipt can be done when all details have been entered.</p>
        <p>First you need to make sure you are in the green backed screen to Enter a Receipt;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FM Tx 02.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the <span class="Name">Account</span> - Using the drop down option, or by typing the account code into the shorter of the two fields in the account section, choose the appropriate account for this receipt.</p>
        <p>Once an Account has been selected a second tab will appear on the top of the screen.</p>
        <p>View Transactions is a list of all Transactions that have been posted for that Account to date.</p>
        <h4>View Transactions</h4>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FM Tx 03.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You may view the transactions for a specific account once it has been selected for use in the receipt option.  This list is not definable but can be printed. You can define a transactions list from the Reports menu.</p>
        <h4>Add a Description</h4>
        <p>The text you enter here will appear on most Reports, this is the narrative you would usually use for this kind of transaction, something must be entered here.</p>
        <h4>Add a Reference – if required</h4>
        <p>Which if entered will also appear on some Reports and on the Bank reconciliation process.</p>
        <h4>Type of Receipt</h4>
        <p>Cash, Cheque etc.  by selecting from the drop down options.  If a Receipt Transaction enters your Bank Account directly it is a Direct Credit.  You will have to identify the Bank Account receiving the funds.  If it is not cash, you will need to choose a Bank Account.</p>
        <h4>Date</h4>
        <p>If the Default Date needs to be changed, use the calendar to select the appropriate date or overtype the entry in the field.</p>
        <h4>Amount</h4>
        <p>Enter the Amount of your single receipt.  If more than one pupil is paying the same amount to the same account with the same type of money (Cash/Cheque) you can select more than one name in the names section and bulk input.  Remember though to input cash and cheque receipts separately.</p>
        <h4>Receipt No</h4>
        <p>The application will generate a sequence beginning at whatever number you start at and continue to offer the next number available.  Receipt numbers are unique.</p>
        <h4>Name section</h4>
        <p>Then select one or more names by using the filter and ticking the box next to their name/s.</p>
        <p>If the name/s already exists you may select it from the list.  If not you can add a new name.   Click the Manage Names button to go to the Manage Names screen, add the additional Name/s, Save and then return to the Receipt screen to complete.</p>
        <p>If you want to select more than one name you can either click beside the names or set a filter to quickly restrict the names list to only those in a particular Year, Class or Group.</p>
        <p>Once you have a list of all names for this transaction - you will see the list grow in the white box on the right if you have chosen more than one name.  If there are more names on subsequent pages you will have to go to each page and repeat this action.  You can remove the tick in any name box once ticked if you make a mistake or remove the name from the list found to the right of the names section by clicking the X next to the appropriate name.</p>
        <p>You may Save, or Save + Print your transaction to any printer on A4 and/or to a specific receipt printer on thermal paper ‘tear off’ roll.  You can also Save + Send SMS if you have subscribed to this option.  Using Abandon will prevent any of the details entered from being saved.</p>
        <p>When Transactions are saved a summary of each one is displayed at the top of the screen.  You can close this display by clicking on the X in the top right corner.  If you enter another Receipt the display will close automatically.</p>
        <h2>Split Receipts/Payments</h2>
        <p>You can split a Receipt or Payment across any number of Accounts and a Receipt across any number of Names.</p>
        <p>When you have entered a Receipt by Cheque/Direct Credit or Recorded a Payment by Cheque/Direct Debit and saved the transaction you can split the amount by following the on screen prompts.</p>
        <p>From the yellow bar at the top of your screen there is the option to ‘split this Receipt/Payment’;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FM Tx 04.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Click on <span class="Name">split this Receipt</span>  or <span class="Name">split this Payment</span></p>
        <p>Select the Account over which the Amount is being split</p>
        <p>If a Receipt Select the Name the Amount is to be recorded against</p>
        <p>Enter the Amount you wish to split from the original Receipt/Payment</p>
        <p>Click on </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To split further if necessary.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Click on</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To complete the action.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Payments will never be split over more than one name.</p>

        <p>Select the <span class="Name">Account</span> - using the drop down option, or by typing the Account Code into the shorter of the two fields in the Account section.  This is the Account to be debited.</p>
        <p>Once an Account has been selected a second tab will appear on the top of the screen.  View Transactions is a list of all transactions that have been recorded for that account to date.</p>
        <h4>View Transactions</h4>

            <img src="../../Images/FM Tx 06.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You may view the Transactions (from the ‘View Transactions’ tab) for a specific Account once it has been selected for use in the Payment option.  This list is not definable, but can be printed. You can define a transactions list from the Reports menu.</p>
        <h4>Add a Description</h4>

        <p>You might like to add the companies you pay to an ‘organisations’ Group in Manage Names.  This would be useful when you need to filter for suppliers.  You can Create a Group in the Manage Names or Manage Accounts screens.</p>
        <p>Once you have the Name of the organisation/staff/pupil etc.  you are paying, tick the box to the left of the Name and Save or Save + Print your Transaction.

        <h4>Transfers Between Names/Accounts</h4>
        <p>This option will allow you to move money from one Account and one Name to another.  As this is not additional income or expenditure it is reported apart from true income and expenditure and appears in the columns Transfers In and Transfers Out on some reports.</p>
        <h2>Transfer Between Accounts</h2>
        <p>From the Transactions tab</p>

        <h2>Brought Forward Balances onto Fund Manager</h2>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">New to Fund Manager</span> - This is a useful tool when you would like to bring brought forward Balances from a previous version of School Fund Manager or another Accounting system onto your new Fund Manager to show who has paid for what previously  e.g. a trip.</p>
        <p>These Balances will be agreed with you when we set up your new Fund Manager and then you will be given instructions on how to transfer these balances to individual pupils during your training. You will then be able to report on these brought forward balances in Reports&gt;Who’s not Paid.</p>
        <h2>Cancel Receipt or Payment Transaction</h2>
        <p>Should a mistake be made, inadvertently we are sure, it is possible to correct it easily (and without drawing the attention of the rest of the world).  The Cancellation option enables corrections to be made in a controlled manner, which does not compromise the integrity of the system.</p>
        <p>From the Transactions tab&gt;Cancel Receipt or Payment Transaction</p>
        <p>You can Cancel a Receipt or Payment Transaction simply by finding or filtering for the transaction, ticking the box next to it on the left and clicking continue at the bottom.  You can cancel more than one transaction at a time.</p>
