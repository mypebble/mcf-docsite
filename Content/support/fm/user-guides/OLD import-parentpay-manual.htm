        <h1>Importing ParentPay transactions manually</h1>
        <p><span class="Name">Issue:</span> I want to import my online payments from ParentPay using the <span class="Name">Import Transactions</span> tab</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution:</span> Create an import file in ParentPay and upload to Fund Manger</p>
        <p>The principle of this exercise is broken down into 5 stages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Understanding what type of account you have for settlement from ParentPay</li>
            <li>Generating a file within ParentPay of all the transactions that you want to import</li>
            <li>Adjusting the file so the data is correct</li>
            <li>Importing the file into Fund Manager</li>
            <li>Dealing with Negative payments</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It is important to note that this process can only be used for importing ePayment transactions. Although cash and cheque transactions can be recorded in ParentPay they cannot be imported into Fund Manager using this process. If you have any transactions in the file that should not be imported use the guidelines in stage 3 to remove these transactions.</p>
        <h4>1. Understanding what type of account you have for ParentPay settlements</h4>
        <p>As a school using ParentPay you will either have monies deposited to your designated bank accounts every fortnight for the periods 1st -15th and 16th – end of the month. This method of deposit to your designated bank account uses the ParentPay Collection Service.</p>
        <p>or</p>
        <p>If your school has ParentPay deposits going directly into your own schools’ bank accounts (usually daily) then this means you are on Direct Settlement.</p>
        <p>Whichever type of ParentPay account you have in school you need to decide how you will import into Fund Manager:</p>
        <p>If you wish to assign each individual ePayment to each pupil that has paid via ParentPay you should generate and import your ParentPay file to the ParentPay Settlement Account in Fund Manager and then transfer the money once imported to the appropriate bank account/s to reconcile to your statements.</p>
        <p>or</p>
        <p>You will need to create a generic account in Fund Manager for transactions to settle to if you do not wish to assign ePayments directly to an individual pupil but to import as a bulk receipt, typically this would be called e.g. ParentPay Receipts. If you choose this method then you need only record the receipts/payments from your bank statement (credits/debits) as they appear on your statement or in advance using your Collection Service Statement/Invoices, reconciling these amounts to your bank statement when it arrives. If you choose this method you do not need to do anything further.</p>
        <p>If you are assigning payments to individual pupils - recommended:</p>
        <p><b>Collection Service Only:</b>:</p>
        <p>a. Firstly you need to check that the money you have received from ParentPay to your designated bank account matches the Collection Service Statement. You do this in ParentPay:</p>
        <p>Go to <span class="Name">Reports &gt;&#160;Reports</span></p>
        <p>Choose <span class="Name">report &gt; Collection Service Statements</span></p>
        <p>Use the filters to check your bank credit against the available statements/dates</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">The difference between your gross and your net settlement should be your Collection Service Invoices which you can enter as a direct debit payment in Fund Manager.</p>
        <p>b. For a Collection Service Settlement Receipt – record as a Payment (direct debit) your charges from your ParentPay Collection Service Invoice to balance the 2 week period credited to your bank account to a Fund Manager account named e.g. ‘ParentPay Bank Charges’. Best practice would be to reconcile from the 1st – 15th of the month and then 16th to the end of the month to match ParentPay’s Collection Service Statements/Invoices. By doing the above your receipts and payments will match your gross ePayments taken in ParentPay as per the Collection Service Statement. You can then go to 3 below.</p>
        <p><b>Direct Settlement Only:</b>
        </p>
        <p>a. Firstly you need to check that the money you have received from ParentPay to your designated bank account matches the ParentPay Reconciler. You do this in ParentPay:</p>
        <p>b. Go to &gt; <span class="Name">Reports &gt; Reports</span></p>
        <p>Choose <span class="Name">report &gt; ParentPay Reconciler</span></p>
        <p>Use the filters to check your bank credit against your ParentPay account</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: "> Your Invoices from your merchant supplier/payment gateway can be entered as a direct debit payment in Fund Manager if they are taken directly from your bank account by them.</p>
        <p>c. For a Direct Settlement Receipt – you will be settled in full to your bank account usually on a daily basis. You can import these transactions daily, weekly, fortnightly or by monthly bank statement.</p>
        <p>d. Record as a Payment (direct debit) your charges from your bank invoice to an account named e.g. ‘ParentPay Bank Charges’ See Section 5. You can then go to Section 3.</p>
        <h4>2. Generating a file within ParentPay of all the transactions that you want to import</h4>
        <p>Within ParentPay go to <span class="Name">Payment Items &gt; Reports</span></p>
        <p>You would usually select &gt; <span class="Name">All</span></p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">In order not to import duplicate transactions always select the date to match your Collection Service Statement i.e. the two week period – 1st to 15th or 16th to the end of the month, or if on Direct Settlement choose and keep a record of which dates you import:</p>
        <p>The screen below should appear:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/FMImpPPTxMan01.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Click on &gt;<span class="Name"> Advanced options</span> below</p>
        <p>Change Payment method to &gt; <span class="Name">ParentPay online</span> or <span class="Name">Paypoint</span></p>
        <p>Tick &gt; <span class="Name">Bank Account</span></p>
        <p>Click &gt; <span class="Name">Excel Full Report</span></p>
        <p>If you have Paypoint transactions as well you can repeat this process to produce another import file and upload separately onto Fund Manager.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">In order not to import duplicate transactions always select at least the day before the current date as the “To date”. Choosing <span class="Name">Processed</span> will ensure only payments that have settled to a bank account will be included in the report.</p>
        <h4>3. Adjusting the file so the data is correct</h4>
        <p>When you initially open the file in Excel it should appear similar to the image below:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/FMImpPPTxMan02.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You will need to manually edit the file so only the transactions you want to import remain and the column headers are correctly labelled.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Cash and cheque transactions should not be on this report, if you have filtered in ParentPay for online only transactions they should not appear- if they do you must delete these lines or start again</p>
        <p>Remove all Negative transactions before importing - these will need to be entered manually after the import.</p>
        <p>Adjust the Excel spreadsheet to have the following headings only:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Service name - modify to Item Title</li>
            <li>Forename</li>
            <li>Surname</li>
            <li>Amount</li>
            <li>Processed date – modify to Date</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>VERY IMPORTANT</b> - delete the top blank line so your file will import</p>
        <p><span class="Name">File &gt; Save As</span>, save the file to your chosen folder making sure to choose the file type <span class="Name">CSV</span> (comma delimited).</p>
        <h4>4. Importing the file into Fund Manager</h4>
        <p>Within Fund Manager go to the <span class="Name">Transactions</span> menu and select <span class="Name">Import ePayments</span>. Upload the CSV file you have just saved by choosing the file and clicking the Upload button. A list of all the transactions that you have imported should appear similar to the screen below. From this screen you will need to select the Account and the Settlement Account you wish to allocate the transactions against from the drop-down list. If you do not already have one, create a suitable Settlement Account from within Fund Manager (<span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Bank Accounts &gt; Create New Account</span>). Using a Settlement Account allows individual ePayments to be recorded in Fund Manager and then once imported you can transfer the total amount from the Settlement Account into your desired Bank Account.</p>
        <p>Work through each of the transactions selecting and matching Name from the drop-down list. The closest matching name should appear at the top of the names list.</p>
        <p><b>You should only import one page at a time.</b>
        </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">If the Name or Account does not appear then you may need to create a new Name or Account via Manage Names or Manage Accounts in Fund Manager and return to this screen to complete the import process.</p>
        <p>Once you have matched the transactions you can import them by clicking the Import button at the bottom of the screen.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">You will not be allowed to import any transactions that you have not matched or if you have not chosen a Settlement Account to place these into.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/FMImpPPTxMan03.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">If you have already imported a file and have had to navigate away to another screen within Fund Manager do not re-import the fileif you wish to return to the import screen. Click View Pending Import and continue from where you left off.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/FMImpPPTxMan04.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Once you have imported your transactions you will be able to transfer the total matching transaction amount from your bank statement from the settlement account to your chosen bank account by doing the following;</p>
        <p>Go to &gt; <span class="Name">Bank &amp; Cash &gt; Transfer between Bank Accounts</span> Transfer from &gt; <span class="Name">Settlement Account </span>&gt; Transfer to &gt; <span class="Name">Chosen Bank Account</span></p>
        <p><span class="Name">Enter amount</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Name">Enter date</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Name">Transfer</span>
        </p>
        <h4>5. Dealing with Negative payments</h4>
        <p>If you find there are debited fees or repayments on your statement for either charges or repayments then you will need to manually <span class="Name">Record a Payment</span> to deal with these in order to balance, if not already done so above.</p>
