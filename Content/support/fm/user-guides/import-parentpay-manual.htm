        <h1>Importing ParentPay transactions manually</h1>
        <p><span class="Name">Issue</span>: I want to import my online payments from ParentPay using the <span class="Name">Import Transactions</span> tab.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution:</span> Create an import file in ParentPay and upload to Fund Manger.</p>
        <p>Within ParentPay, go to <span class="Name">Reports&gt;Payments</span>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose service or all.</li>
            <li>Select dates.</li>
            <li>Click on <span class="Name">advanced options</span>.</li>
            <li>Select Payment status: <span class="Name">Processed</span>.</li>
            <li>Select Payment method: <span class="Name">ParentPay online or Paypoint</span>.</li>
            <li>Open in Excel.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">In order not to import duplicate transactions always select at least the day before the current date as the <span class="Name">To date</span>.  Choosing <span class="Name">Processed</span> will ensure only payments that have settled to a bank account will be included in the report.</p>
        <h2>Method:</h2>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Cash and cheque transactions can be created on a separate report and brought into Fund Manager if you wish; if you have filtered in ParentPay for online only transactions they should not appear- you will need to create a separate file for these and either join the reports together or Import them one at a time. Please ensure you then change <span class="Name">Means</span> to <span class="Name">Type</span> on the csv and re-save in order to upload successfully, cash and cheque transactions.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Delete the top blank line so your file will import and filter out any unwanted transactions before you save your Report.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Save the file to your chosen folder making sure to choose the file type CSV.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Within Fund Manager go to <span class="Name">Transactions&gt; Import Transactions</span>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Browse and choose file.</li>
            <li>Upload file.</li>
            <li>Filter in the middle box for <span class="Name">Type</span> of transaction and which <span class="Name">Description</span> you wish to import first&gt;Filter</li>
            <li>By using the <span class="Name">Filter</span> button your <span class="Name">Pupil Names</span> should appear against the <span class="Name">Transactions</span></li>
            <li>Check that the <span class="Name">Account Code</span> is correct and you are using the <span class="Name">Settlement Account</span> on the right.</li>
            <li>Once you are satisfied that everything matches you can click import on the first page and repeat as necessary.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">If the name or account does not appear then you may need to create a new name or account via <span class="Name">Manage Names</span> or <span class="Name">Manage Accounts</span> in Fund Manager and return to this screen to complete the import process, Fund Manager will remember what you haven’t imported when you return to this page</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">You will not be allowed to import any transactions that you have not matched or if you have not chosen a <span class="Name">Settlement Account</span> to place these in, nor will Fund Manager let you import transactions already imported or out of the <span class="Name">Period Date</span> range</p>
        <p>Once you have imported your transactions you will be able to transfer the total <span class="Name">Transaction amount</span> from your <span class="Name">Statement</span> from the <span class="Name">Settlement Account</span> to your chosen <span class="Name">Bank Account</span> by doing the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <span class="Name">Bank &amp; Cash</span>.</li>
            <li>Transfer between Bank Accounts.</li>
            <li>Transfer from <span class="Name">Settlement Account</span>.</li>
            <li>Transfer to chosen <span class="Name">Bank Account</span>.</li>
            <li>Enter <span class="Name">Amount</span>.</li>
            <li>Enter <span class="Name">Date</span>.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Name">Transfer</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can then ‘Record a Payment’ for the debited fees (invoices on ParentPay) on your bank account statement to balance.</p>
