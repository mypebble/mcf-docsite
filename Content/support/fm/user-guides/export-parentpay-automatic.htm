        <h1>Exporting Receipts from Fund Manager to ParentPay automatically</h1>
        <p><span class="Name">Issue:</span> I want to process a Receipt in Fund Manager and then export some or all of my cash, cheques and direct credit transactions from Fund Manager to ParentPay so parents can see what they have paid.</p>
        <p><span class="Name">Solution:</span> Create a link between Fund Manager and ParentPay using the <span class="Name">ParentPay</span> tab in Fund Manager. You will need help from Support to use this for the first time.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Within Fund Manager go to <span class="Name">ParentPay &gt; Map Accounts/Payment Items</span>.</li>
            <li>Choose <span class="Name">Set Primary Payment Item</span>.</li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">This second tab behind the <span class="Name">Match Payment Items</span> tab needs to be activated by Support if you do not see this.</p>
            <li>Using this tab <span class="Name">Set Primary Payment Item</span> you can match the <span class="Name">Account Code</span> (from Fund Manager) on the left with the corresponding <span class="Name">Payment Item</span> in ParentPay.</li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Please be aware that you can only choose to map one Payment Item to one Fund Manager Account; you might have several Payment Items mapped to one <span class="Name">Account Code</span> in Fund Manager on the <span class="Name">Match Payment Items</span> tab but you cannot export back in the same way.</p>
            <li>Ignore any <span class="Name">Payment Items</span> that you do not want to map, for example, parents do not need to see what has been paid by cash, cheque etc.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Name">Set Primary Payment Items</span> to confirm selection.</li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">You can only choose <span class="Name">Payment Items</span> that have <span class="Name">Choose a Payment Item</span> in the dropdown.</p>
            <li>Once you have matched these <span class="Name">Payment Items</span>, cash, cheques and direct credits will export from Fund Manager to ParentPay. </li>
            <p><b>Important!</b> Do not enter these transactions in ParentPay as well or you will duplicate your transactions.</p>
        </ol>
