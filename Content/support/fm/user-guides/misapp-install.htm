            <img src="../../Images/FMMISappInstInstr03.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Accept the license agreement and click &gt; Install.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMMISappInstInstr04.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMMISappInstInstr05.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Wait for installer to finish.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMMISappInstInstr06.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Once finished, click &gt; Finish.  </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMMISappInstInstr07.png" />
        </p>
        <p>MISapp is set to run afterwards by default and once MISapp has started it will open on the Network Tab.</p>
        <h2>Configuring MISapp</h2>
        <p>To configure Pebble MISapp click on the <span class="Name">Schools</span> Tab</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMMISappInstInstr08.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Click <span class="Name">Add</span> to add your School</p>
        <p>Fill in all the fields in the SIMS Information section. This relates to your access to sims.net.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMMISappInstInstr09.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You will need :-</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The School Name</li>
            <li>Your Sims Username and Password</li>
            <li>The location of your database which is found in connect.ini</li>
            <li>Your MISapp Username and the Organisation ID we provided to you in the Preparation email.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You will need to call us for the password if you have not so already. If you do not have this information please call us on 0845 310 1788 option 2</p>
        <p>MISapp will attempt to fill in the Server and Database fields automatically by reading the Sims connect.ini file.</p>
        <p class="note">It is possible that the connect.ini file redirects to another connect.ini file on the server, and there may be multiple redirects.</p>
        <p>MISapp attempts to follow the redirects but might fail in some circumstances.</p>
        <p>If the fields remain blank then it may be necessary to manually look at the connect.ini file and follow the redirect to the correct Sims file location.</p>
        <p>Checking the MISapp Log (GUI) tab will show how far it got and the paths it was searching.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, the default server and database names could be used which are (local)\sims2008 and SIMS respectively. Please seek your school’s IT Support advice if you need help with your Sims location settings.</p>
        <p>When you have entered your SIMS Information Click <span class="Name">Test</span></p>
        <p>If all the entries are correct you will see the message - Sims information correct</p>
        <p>If the message shows anything different e.g. 'Sims information incorrect', or 'Missing Sims permissions'</p>
        <p class="note"> In the case of missing Sims permissions, the Sims user may not have been added to the relevant groups as advised in the Preparation email. Please ensure that it is a member of the following groups - <span class="Name">Third Party Reporting</span>, <span class="Name">Class Teacher</span>, <span class="Name">Admin Assistant and Personnel Assistant</span>.</p>
        <p>If in doubt, please call us so that we may assist you.</p>
        <p>If you need to repeat this please refer to the preparation document. If you require another copy please send an email to support@mypebble.co.uk</p>
        <p>Complete the second section with the Pebble Information you have been provided and click Test</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMMISappInstInstr10.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Once both Tests have passed, click &gt; Save. If you select Cancel this will leave the window without saving any of the details you have entered.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMMISappInstInstr11.png" />
        </p>
        <p>More Schools can be added, edited or deleted by selecting them from the list on the Schools Tab and clicking <span class="Name">Add</span>, <span class="Name">Edit</span> or <span class="Name">Delete</span>.  This is especially useful for those schools with a central/hosted SIMS server.</p>
        <p>Next click <span class="Name">Schedule</span> tab.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Name">Schedule</span> tab allows you to select when you would like <span class="Name">MISapp</span> to <span class="Name">Run</span>, this is set up by default to Run at 02:00 am every day. Alternatively you can choose to <span class="Name">Run MISapp</span> at a different time or Run immediately (Run Task) if you are aware of Sims updates and want them reflected in Fund Manager immediately.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMMISappInstInstr12.png" />
            <img src="../../Images/FMMISappInstInstr13.png" />
        </p>
        <p>To change the Task time simply scroll to the desired time and then Click <span class="Name">Register Task</span></p>
        <p>If the Task was added successfully, it should look like the box below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMMISappInstInstr14.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Clicking <span class="Name">Run Task</span> will Run the reports and send data for all the schools which were added in the previous step, essentially what the Task will be doing every night but on demand.</p>
        <p>To Remove the Task Click <span class="Name">Remove Task</span></p>
        <p>Now <span class="Name">Run</span> the Task to ensure that the schedule is created and that the reports are sent correctly.</p>
        <p>When the task starts running the MISapp configurator will automatically change to the Log(Task) tab.  This could take some time depending on how much data there is to send - generally between 2 and 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>Once the Task has finished, the Tab Log (Task) will list the events that have run as shown below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMMISappInstInstr15.png" />
        </p>
        <p>If the Log states INFO data sent to pebble successfully and you receive no error messages,the data has transferred successfully.</p>
        <p>You will be able to see the updated pupil results in Fund Manager generally within 30 minutes.</p>
        <h2>Uninstalling</h2>
        <p><span class="Name">MISapp</span> can be uninstalled from either Control Panel or from the Pebble Misapp program group in the start menu.</p>
