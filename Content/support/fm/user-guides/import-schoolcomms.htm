        <h1>Importing Schoolcomms Transactions</h1>
        <p>The principle of this exercise is broken down into 3 stages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Generating a file within Schoolcomms of all the online Transactions that you want to Import</li>
            <li>Checking the file so the data is correct</li>
            <li>Importing the file into Fund Manager</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It is important to note that this process can only be used for importing online ePayment transactions. Cash and Cheques can be recorded in Schoolcomms but you will have to import each type of payment via a separate CSV file.</p>
        <h4>Step 1 - Generating a file within Schoolcomms of all the Transactions that you want to Import</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Within Schoolcomms, go to <span class="Name">Payments &gt; Reports</span>.</li>
            <li>Choose <span class="Name">Transactions – Day Book</span>.</li>
            <li>Choose <span class="Name">Date range you wish to Import</span> (always a date before today’s).</li>
            <li>Choose <span class="Name">Method &gt; Online only</span> (you can then repeat the following steps for Cash and Cheque transactions).</li>
            <li>Apply filter and Export.</li>
            <p>The Report will usually save as a .xls. Save the file to somewhere you can easily find it with a file name that reflects the dates you are importing.</p>
        </ol>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">In order not to Import duplicate transactions always select the day before the current Date as the “To Date”</p>
        <h4>Step 2 -     Checking the file so the data and column headers are correct</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>When you initially open the file in Excel you may need to manually edit the file so only the Transactions you want to Import remain (e.g. you might have Dinner money in the Report that you do not wish to Import into Fund Manager - delete these payments). </li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">To remove rows of data before saving you can use the filter option or by selecting the row(s) and right clicking the mouse to select "delete".</p>
            <li>Cash and Cheque Transactions should be Imported in separate CSV files.</li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Change <span class="Name">Method</span> to <span class="Name">Type</span>.</p>
            <li>Re-Save the file type as a <span class="Name">CSV – comma delimited</span> to somewhere you can easily find it with a file name that reflects the Dates you are Importing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Step 3 -      Importing the file into Fund Manager</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Within Fund Manager go to <span class="Name">Transactions &gt; Import Payments</span>. </li>
            <li>
                <p>Any <span class="Name">Pending Uploads</span> will be visible straight away. Clear these at the bottom of the screen if you no longer need to import these transactions for any reason.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Upload the CSV file you have just saved by choosing the file and clicking the <span class="Name">Upload</span> button. A list of all the Transactions that you have Imported should appear. From this screen you will need to select from the drop-down list either <span class="Name">All Transactions</span> (if ePayments) or Cash or Cheque.</li>
            <li>Choose Account</li>
            <li>Click Filter</li>
            <li>Choose Account Code in Fund Manager if it does not match the Account Code you want to allocate the payments to.</li>
            <p>The closest matching Name should appear at the top of the Names list for you to double check you agree with Fund Manager’s choice that is offered.</p>
            <li>Once you have matched all of the Names (or have reached the end of the page) for the first Account click on <span class="Name">Import</span>.</li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">If the Account does not appear then you may need to Create a New Account via Manage Accounts in Fund Manager. Click Leave and then return to this screen to complete the Import process</p>
            <li>Do each Account (trip/visit/item) at a time, one page at a time, then repeat the process with the different Accounts until you have finished the Import.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: "> You will not be allowed to Import any Transactions that you have not matched or if you have not chosen an Account or Settlement Account to place these against or it has previously been imported.</p>
        <h4>View imported ePayments</h4>
        <p>You can view your Imported ePayments via <span class="Name">Transactions &gt; Search Transactions</span>, choosing the ePayment option under ‘Type’</p>
        <p>Once you have Imported your Transactions you will be able to Transfer the total Transaction amounts you see on your Bank Statements from the Settlement Account to your chosen Bank Account by doing the following;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to Bank &amp; Cash</li>
            <li>Transfer between Bank Accounts</li>
            <li>Transfer from &gt; Settlement Account</li>
            <li>Transfer to &gt; Chosen Bank Account</li>
            <li>Enter amount</li>
            <li>Enter date</li>
            <li>Transfer</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can then ‘Record a Payment’ for the Transaction fees in the normal way via Transactions &gt; Record a Payment</p>
