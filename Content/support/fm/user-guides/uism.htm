        <h1>Universal Infant Free School Meals</h1>
        <p>In order to record and report on Universal Infant Free School Meals, you will need access to Fund Manager’s Register tab. If you haven’t got it, please get in touch with <a href="https://www.mypebble.co.uk/#contact-form" target="_blank">Pebble’s Sales Team</a>.</p>
        <h4>Highlights</h4>
        <p>From September 2014, all pupils in reception, year 1 and year 2 in state-funded schools in England will be eligible for free school meals (UIFSMs).</p>
        <p>To help you manage this, you can assign pupils to a UIFSM group within Fund Manager and generate reports to keep track of the number of free meals that are being taken.</p>
        <h4>Creating a UIFSM Group and Adding Eligible Pupils</h4>
        <p>In order to record the number of Universal Infant Free School Meals that are being taken, you will need to create a UIFSM group to which you can assign your eligible pupils.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">For the Universal Infant Free School Meals reports to function correctly, all pupils must be assigned to a <span class="Name">Group</span> called Pupils. You can do this via the <span class="Name">Manage Names</span> screen.</p>
        <p>Go to <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Names</span> and click <span class="Name">Create Group</span> in the <span class="Name">Group Actions</span> section.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In the Manage Groups box, <span class="Name">Enter a Name</span> for your Universal Infant Free School Meals group and select “User Defined” as the <span class="Name">Group Type</span>.</p>
        <p>Once you have created your Universal Infant Free School Meals group you will need to add your eligible pupils.</p>
        <p>You can do this by clicking the checkbox next to each pupil in <span class="Name">Manage Names</span>, selecting the group via <span class="Name">Group Actions</span> then clicking <span class="Name">Add to Group</span></p>
        <h4>Assigning a UIFSM Group to your Register Account</h4>
        <p>When you have created your Universal Infant Free School Meals group and added your eligible pupils, you will need to assign it to your Register Account in order to record the number of free meals being taken.</p>
        <p>Go to <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Accounts</span> and click on the account name for your Register Account. This will then bring up the <span class="Name">Update Account </span>screen.</p>
