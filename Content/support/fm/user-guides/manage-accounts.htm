        <h1>Managing Accounts</h1>
        <p>All the functions for setting up <span class="Name">Accounts</span> in Fund Manager are on the <span class="Name">Administration</span> Tab and the details of some accounts may have been added during your Set Up.  Other Accounts can be added as and when required.</p>
        <p>There are three sections, <span class="Name">Manage Account</span>, <span class="Name">Manage Bank Accounts</span> and <span class="Name">Manage Ledger Codes</span>.</p>
        <p>An <span class="Name">Account</span> is equivalent to an individual column header in a manual ledger. Accounts can be created at any time.  There is no effective limit to the number of Accounts you may have, but each one must have its own unique Code.</p>
        <p>The Account Code is a combination of between 1 and 6 letters and numbers.  Once saved, a code and an account name can be edited but can never be deleted; Instead Accounts are taken ‘Out of Use’ when you have no further need of them.  This prevents them from appearing on the transaction screens.  They may continue to appear on the report screens if they have a balance which is relevant to the open financial period.</p>
        <p>A <span class="Name">Bank Account</span> can be any account held with a bank that is used for the purposes of managing your Fund, eg current account, Savings accounts etc.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Name">Ledger Codes</span> option is available for providing exports into other finance packages to allow you to continue providing unified reports (eg VAT reporting), whilst gaining the benefits of Fund Manager's superior transaction entry. Set up your ledger codes in Fund Manager to match the Ledger codes in your external finance package. Then you can assign debit and credit entries to the correct ledgers to make accounting easier (e.g. grouping all trip transactions etc).</p>
        <h4>To view and edit your Accounts;</h4>
        <p>On the <span class="Name">Dashboard</span> (Organisation Summary) &gt;  <span class="Name">Accounts</span></p>
        <p>OR</p>
        <p>Go to  <span class="Name">Administration	&gt; Manage Accounts</span></p>
        <p>Here you will see all the Accounts that have been set up in your Fund Manager.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMmanageaccounts01.png" />
        </p>
        <p>By clicking on any of the Account Names you can then edit the Account details, mark it ‘Out of Use’, Share Balances (with Joinos), Create and Assign to a Group, Assign or change an Opening Balance, Budget and Unit Cost.  The Unit Cost needs to be recorded if you would like to use the ‘Who’s Not Paid’ Report in the reporting section (see section on Reporting).</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>You may add details of the Budget value - a negative Budget value indicates an expected level of expenditure or loss.  A positive Budget value indicates an expected level of income or profit.  This might be useful for budget holders to know their budget position by simply looking in Fund Manager for the funds that remain available.</p>

        <p>The options in these sections can be applied to more than one account at a time.</p>
        <p>Once an account is no longer required for daily use you can mark it Out of Use. Tick the box next to the Account then tick the radio Box &gt; <span class="Name">Out of Use</span>.  If you need to report on an archived account simply click on the button  &gt;  <span class="Name">Show Out of Use</span>.</p>

        <p>You can create a Group for your Accounts, e.g. Trips, off site, overseas, 6th form etc.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMmanageaccounts04.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Groups are then used with the filter options throughout the application to quickly create reports.  The Accounts in the Group will be reported individually and with a subtotal.</p>
        <p>Create your Group first and then click the Accounts you want to be added to that Group.  Accounts can be quickly added or removed from groups.  Once an Account has been added to a group you will see the details in the group’s column beside the account names.  You can have multiple groups against each name.</p>
        <p>When you see the accounts list throughout the application, it will be presented in account code order.  Numbers then letters, alphabetically.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">If you need a new Group you can create one in the same way as you can Manage Names (see Manage Names section),  from the bottom of the Manage Accounts screen.</p>

        <h2>Manage Bank Accounts</h2>
        <p>Many schools operate with a single Bank Account for their School Fund.  The system comes with one such Account already defined.  This is called 'Current Account' but you may edit this Bank Name if you wish.  Click on the <span class="Name">Current Account</span> Name and then overtype the Name 'Current Account' with whatever you want your Bank Account to be called.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMmanageaccounts08.png" />
        </p>
        <p>If you have more than one Bank Account you may create additional accounts by clicking on Create Bank Account button.  You will need to add a unique Code and an Account Name.  However the name of the Default Account should NOT be changed from code CURR.  The Account Name normally includes the name of the bank itself and the type of account.  This information can be edited when necessary.</p>

        <h2>View Opening Balances</h2>
        <p>The Opening Balances of your Accounts will usually have been entered by one of the Pebble Support team when you first begin using Fund Manager.  If you create additional Bank Accounts you can set up the Opening Balance in the Manage Bank Accounts tab (above).  These will also be the Opening Balances for the new financial year following a Period End Closedown.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMmanageaccounts11.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Here you can see ALL your Accounts and the Balances that have been set. The totals of the two columns should always match.  The Difference should always be 0.00.</p>
        <h4>Manage Ledger Codes</h4>
        <p>To create these codes click the options New Ledge Code of New Bank Ledger Code</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMmanageaccounts12.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Period End Closedown</h2>
        <p>You will need to close down your Fund Manager at some point after your Period End.</p>
        <p>Once the end date for your financial period has passed you can perform a Period End Closedown in Fund Manager that will draw a line under your transactions and allow you to produce the necessary reports to submit to your auditor.</p>
        <p>The objective of a closedown is to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Draw a line under your transactions for the period</li>
            <li>Close any accounts that will not be used in the next period</li>
            <li>Determine which accounts will have their balances transferred to the new period</li>
            <li>      Balance your income and expenditure for the period with that of your bank</li>
        </ol>
        <p>During the Period End Closedown, Fund Manager will automatically carry forward your account closing balances and present them as the opening balances in the next period</p>
        <p>Once you select 'Confirm' your system is locked down into a draft close down, this is not fully closed and may be undone at any time. However, your transactions are moved into an archive state. Once your auditors have fully agreed and signed off your paper work, you may then close down your system completely.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: "> You are still able to enter transaction in your current financial year while this close down is occurring.</p>
        <p>Once you have confirmed your Period End Closedown all transactions within the closed period date range are completely locked and you will be no longer able to amend any transactions in the closed period or roll back to an unclosed date.</p>
        <p>Before you start to do your Closedown, there is some preparation to do:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Determine which accounts are to be closed</li>
            <li>Clear any closing balances which are not required in the next financial period</li>
            <li>   Determine which accounts are to be retained with their balance in the next financial period</li>
            <li>Reconcile all bank accounts up to or beyond the close down date</li>
            <li>   Print out the list of Cancelled Transactions if necessary</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>1 -       Determine which accounts are to be closed</h4>
        <p>Go to <span class="Name">Reports  &gt;  Search Account Balances</span></p>
        <p>Put the Period Dates into the date fields (you can see your period beginning date on the Dashboard in the Transactions section).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMmanageaccounts13.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You can verify here if the closing balances are correct for the start of your new financial period. Tick the <span class="Name">Include Out of Use</span> box and click <span class="Name">Search</span></p>
        <p>The ‘Out of Use’ accounts appear greyed out on this report.</p>
        <p>Now you can see all the Accounts each with their closing Balance (column on the extreme right).</p>
        <p>You can verify here if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>	the closing balances are correct for the start of your new financial period</li>
            <li>	the account will be used in the next financial period</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For those accounts that are not to be used in the next period AND have a balance of zero you just need to confirm they have been marked ‘Out of Use’, (greyed out on this report).</p>
        <p>To take an account <span class="Name">Out of Use</span>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Accounts</span></li>
            <li>Click on the box beside the account(s) that you want to take Out of Use (note you can see the account balances here)</li>
            <li>Click in the Radio button beside ‘Out of Use’</li>
            <li>Click Update Account(s) button (note the accounts will become greyed out)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you want an Account balance to be something other than the closing balance on the report you will need to make an Account Transfer.</p>
        <p>To clear a balance to zero, transfer money out of the Account, to increase the balance transfer money in.  You can create a temporary holding Account for these Transfers to go into until you have determined the appropriate accounts to be used;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <span class="Name">Administration   &gt;  Manage Accounts   &gt;  Create New Account</span></li>
            <li>Create the New Account with a Code e.g. TEMP – End of Year Temporary Account then <span class="Name">Save</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Please record all these Account Transfers with a date within the financial period you are closing.</p>
        <h4>2.       Clear any closing balances which are not required in the next financial period</h4>
        <p>To Transfer money between Accounts;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to <span class="Name">Transactions  &gt;  Transfer Money Between Accounts</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you need to Transfer any Balances please record all these Account Transfers with a date within the financial period you are closing</p>
        <h4>3.       Determine which accounts are to be retained with their balance in the next financial period</h4>
        <p>Return to <span class="Name">Reports &gt; Search Account Balances</span> and make sure the box for ‘Include Out of Use’ is ticked, otherwise you may not see all of your accounts. The ‘Out of Use’ accounts appear greyed out on this report.</p>
        <p>Put the Period Dates into the date fields, (you can see your period beginning date on the Dashboard).</p>
        <p>You should check that all the accounts are listed with their balance that is to be retained in the new financial period and appear greyed out if they are no longer required.</p>
        <h4>4.       Reconcile all bank accounts up to or beyond the close down date</h4>
        <p>All your bank accounts must be reconciled to or past your Period End Date.</p>
        <p>If you have a Savings Account or an Inactive account where the balance hasn’t changed since you have last reconciled it you must reconcile the bank account with an end date either on or after your close down date.</p>
        <p>You can also do a bank reconciliation without any transactions.  Please only do this if there has been no change in the account balance, otherwise please request a statement from you bank or wait until you receive your statement.</p>
        <p>To do this select the same amount for the closing balance as the opening balance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to <span class="Name">Bank &amp; Cash &gt; Reconcile a Bank Statement</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Select a Bank Account from the drop down list</li>
                <li>Click Reconcile This Account</li>
                <li>Enter the appropriate statement details with an end date ON or AFTER the close down date</li>
                <li>Complete the reconciliation as usual by selecting the items which appear on the statement (or if reconciling a zero item statement then simply press Reconcile).</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>You must do this for ALL your bank accounts. You must complete one reconciliation before you can start another irrespective of how many bank accounts you have. When this is complete you can proceed to create a Draft Period End report.</p>
        <h4>5.       Print out the list of Cancelled Transactions if necessary</h4>
        <p>If you need a list of all the transactions that you have cancelled throughout the year you will need to print this before closing the period or beginning the Period End closure routine.  To do this go to <span class="Name">Reports &gt; List of Cancellations</span>.</p>
        <h2>How to Create a Draft Period End Closedown</h2>
        <p>You will need to create a Draft Period End Closedown which will generate all the Reports required for a financial period.</p>
