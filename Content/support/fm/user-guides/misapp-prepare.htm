        <h1>MISapp Preparation Instructions</h1>
        <p>MISapp is a small application that runs alongside SIMS.net. It runs daily to import new and update existing names within Fund Manager. Some fields are mandatory as part of the import process however you have the option of excluding all or some of the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Name">UPN</span> Is the Unique Pupil Number allocated to each pupil (This option only applies to new customers)</li>
            <li><span class="Name">Contacts</span> Are the parent/guardian contact details for each pupil</li>
            <li><span class="Name">Groups</span> Are the groups that a pupil is linked to i.e. free school meals</li>
            <li><span class="Name">Staff</span> Are the staff members held in your MIS system</li>
            <li><span class="Name">Attendance</span> Is the pupil attendance records</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">If you would prefer to exclude any of the items listed above from being imported into Fund Manager you must notify a member of the support team before you run MISapp.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>SIMS.net Preparation</li>
            <p>You MUST have completed the SIMS.net preparation stages before installing MISapp. Follow the instructions below to ensure you have the correct permissions and access to SIMS.net, which is a requirement before you install the MISapp.</p>
            <p>You MUST be a member of the following groups - <span class="Name">Admin Assistant</span>, <span class="Name">Class Teacher</span>, <span class="Name">Personnel Assistant and Third Party Reporting</span> in order to use MISapp.  To check if you are a member of these groups go to menu option:</p>
            <p>Focus &gt; System Manager &gt; Manage Users</p>
            <p>Search for your ID and check the groups you belong to in Section 3.  If you do not have all these groups please contact your System Manager and ask to be added.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, you could create a System or Admin id which only uses these groups instead.</p>
            <li>           Fund Manager Preparation</li>
            <p>Before installing MISapp, mark any pupils and staff that have left the school as “Out of Use”.   For more information on how to manage names in Fund Manager please read <MadCap:xref href="manage-names.htm">Managing Names</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            <p class="note">MISapp does not automatically mark school leavers out of use.</p>
            <p>When you have completed the preparations above download the <MadCap:xref href="misapp-install.htm">MISapp Installation Instructions</MadCap:xref> for the installation instructions for MISapp. The link to download MISapp is also in the email you were sent.</p>
