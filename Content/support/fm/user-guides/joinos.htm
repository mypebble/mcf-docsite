        <h1>Joinos User Guide</h1>
        <p>Joinos is an e-Payment system which allows Parents/Carers (and even a Staff member) to pay for items using an online portal.  This is linked directly to Fund Manager and provides one simple account that links to a child’s school.</p>
        <p>Parents can stay up-to-date via computer or mobile phone (using the mobile site). They can make payments online, view their transactions and balances, receive and return permission slips and other documents.</p>
        <p>It’s simple, convenient, and it’s completely free for all parents.  Joinos benefits everyone. It makes things easier for school and parents/carers but also reduces the administrative burden on the school. helping to cut back on the amount of paper and envelopes sent out.</p>

        <h3><a name="Step1"></a>1 - Registering Joinos Students</h3>
        <p>Before any parent/carer/ staff member can pay for an offer, they should first be registered on the system.</p>
        <p>The student’s Joinos code is then created and given to the Parent/ Carer / Staff member to activate.  Once this is done these Students/Staff can then receive offers about items that can be purchased online using Joinos.</p>
        <p>There are three tabs which are used to designate the stages of registration.  These are <span class="Name">Create Joinos Codes</span>, <span class="Name">Joinos Codes</span> and <span class="Name">Manage Connections</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="Name">Create Joinos Codes</span> - This show all the students/staff who are waiting to be registered on Joinos, this includes all new Students/Staff at the School or those who have never been registered.</p>
        <p>There is a Show Registered button on this tab and clicking on this will show not only those Students and Staff who have not been registered, but also all who have been registered but have not been activated and those who have an active connection to Joinos due to the Parent/Carer/Staff member logging onto Joinos and activating the Joinos Code.</p>
        <p><span class="Name">Joinos Codes</span> - These are all the Students/Staff who have had a Joinos Code created with the Creation and Expiry Date and who have not yet been activated in Joinos.  </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">All codes are valid for 3 months.  Any codes not activated within that time will expire and a new code will need to be created as and when necessary.</p>
        <p><span class="Name">Manage Connections</span> - these are all the Students/Staff who have been registered and are active within Joinos.</p>
        <h4>To Register Students/Staff</h4>
        <p>Click on <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Create Joinos Codes</span> and filter for the name required.</p>
        <p>If you can't find them in the list click the Show Registered button and they should appear in there.</p>
        <p>Click on the Tick box to the left of the name and click <span class="Name">Create Joinos Codes</span> button</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMJoinos01.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Their name will now disappear from the Create Joinos Codes tab and a message will appear at the top of the screen to say that “Your Joinos Codes have been created”.  You can create more than one code at a time by clicking on the tick box and the names will appear in the white box on the right side of the screen.</p>
        <p>Click on the <span class="Name">Joinos Codes</span> tab and their name should be showing with the code.  An example letter for sending the information for parents should have been given to you during your training.  There is also one attached to this User Guide at <a href="#Step11">Appendix A</a>.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue:</span> If a parent can’t see their child in Joinos, this is most likely caused by the Joinos code which, if not used, will expire after three months.  With regard to the children whose Joinos codes have expired, you will need to recreate their Joinos codes and then inform the parents to use this new code.</p>
        <h4>Cancelling a Joinos Code</h4>
        <p>Sometimes it is necessary to cancel a Joinos code and to do this go to <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Connections</span></p>
        <p>Find the name you wish to cancel the connection on and when open click <span class="Name">Remove</span> under the Disconnect Column</p>

        <h3><a name="Step4"></a>4   - Transfer Joinos payments to Bank Account ready to Reconcile</h3>
        <p>Within Fund Manager, you are required to have a Joinos Settlement Account that all of the money is imported into and this should have been set up for you before or during Training.</p>
        <p>In Fund Manager, your monies are put into your Joinos Settlement Account, you must transfer the <span class="Name">GROSS</span> to your Current Account (or desired bank account) - This will show as a Debit from the Joinos account and a Credit against your Current Account.</p>
        <p>Requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transfer From: Joinos Settlement Account*</li>
            <li>Transfer To: Your desired bank account to reconcile</li>
            <li>Amount</li>
            <li>Date</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once complete, you can now select ‘ Transfer’ - The amount will now show in against the bank account selected, within the reconciliation screen.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMJoinos08.png" />
        </p>
        <h3><a name="Step5"></a>5	- Recording Joinos Charges</h3>
        <p>After the transfer(s) are complete, you must now record any ‘bank charges’ back into the Current Account.  To do this, you must have a user account setup labeled (eg  Bank Charges).  You should also have an organisation name to transact against (eg Joinos Bank Charges).</p>
        <p>You must record a Payment (Direct Debit) against the Current Bank account of the amount of the Charges.  You will already have transferred the GROSS amount from the Settlement Bank account which includes the e-payments and also includes your charge(s).</p>
        <p>You <span class="Emphasis">MUST</span> record these back in against your Current Account as a Direct Debit and NOT against the Settlement Account.</p>
        <p>You will now be ready to record the transaction, to do this, go to <span class="Name">Transactions &gt; Record a Payment</span>.</p>
        <p>In this screen you will now select your user account (Bank Charges) and of course, your new name.

        <h3><a name="Step6"></a>6	- Reconciling Joinos (First Data) Statements</h3>
        <p>To reconcile, confirm that the payments have been made and then any charges are entered manually.  When you receive your Bank Statement which has Joinos payments in you can then move the gross amount from the Settlement Account using transfer, if you have not already done so - section 4 above.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">You can enter the card fees/charges as you would any invoice in Transactions &gt; Record a Payment and use the Direct Debit Type option see section 5 above</span>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>	In your Fund Manager, your monies are put into your Joinos Settlement Account, you must transfer the <span class="Emphasis">GROSS</span> to your Current Account (or desired bank account) - This will show as a Debit from the Joinos account and a Credit against your Current Account.</li>
            <li>Once you have transferred your amounts you must now record the charges. You <span class="Emphasis">MUST</span> record these back in against your Current Account as a Direct Debit and NOT against the Settlement Account. Before you record the transaction, you will need to create a user account called 'Joinos Charges' and a name to match. Please enter these in your Administration screen.</li>
            <li>You will now be ready to record the transaction, to do this, go to <span class="Name">Transactions &gt; Record a Payment </span>- In this screen you will now select your newly created user account (Joinos Charges) and of course, your new name. Fill out the relevant information and the amount of your charge then select your Type as Direct Debit - Here you must ensure you bank account (in the centre of your payments screen) is your Current Account. - Finally, select save.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You will now have your original <span class="Emphasis">gross</span> transfer and the direct debit refund/charge against your current account ready to reconcile.</p>
        <h3><a name="Step7"></a>7	- How does a Parent/Carer Register and add their child?</h3>
        <p>For a Parent/Carer to be able to pay online they need to have registered with Joinos where they can make payments using a credit or debit card, view receipts for transactions and check account balances. They will always be up-to-date with your school news and events via Joinos messages and there will be no-more searching for permission slips or consent forms with online documents.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Joinos codes may expire if not used promptly so please ask them not to delay in activating their account.</p>
        <p>They can access Joinos from their computer, tablet or mobile phone wherever they happen to be.</p>
        <p>For a Parent to Register they will need their child’s Joinos Code which is provided by the School.  There is a letter that can be provided and this can be found in Appendix A.</p>
        <p>They register by following the instructions contained in the letter.</p>
        <p>To add a second child logon to Joinos if necessary.</p>
        <p>Click Settings &gt;<span class="Name"> Add New Child</span> &gt; enter the Joinos code &gt; <span class="Name">Continue</span></p>
        <h3><a name="Step8"></a>8 -	Sending the Parent/Carer an Email or SMS message</h3>
        <p>You can use Fund Manager to send the Parent/Carer an email or SMS message to inform them of important information, new/amended offers, reminders etc.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMJoinos10.png" />
        </p>
        <p>When you click on <span class="Name">Messaging &gt; Joinos, New Message</span>, the following screen is shown ready for you to insert a title and text message in the Body field.  You can select an attachment from the list which is already uploaded.  (See section above re uploading documents).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMJoinos11.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">  You can also send an SMS alert by ticking the box at the bottom of the page.  (This will only work where the student had a phone number listed.)</p>
        <p>Select the students you wish to send the message to then click <span class="Name">Send</span>.</p>
        <p>Confirmation is then shown at the top of Fund Manager:</p>

        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: "> Most, but not all, home telephones are able to receive text messages, but where possible a mobile number is preferable.  You can, however, specify in Fund Manager, which phone number (where there are two or more) is the primary.</p>
        <p>Click on <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Names</span>, search for the pupil, click the <span class="Name">Manage Phone Numbers</span> tab &gt; choose the <span class="Name">Primary Phone</span></p>

        </p>
        <p>To send an SMS Text message &gt; <span class="Name">Messaging &gt; SMS, Sent Text Message</span> &gt; type the text message (Remember that only the standard text length - 160 characters is allowed) &gt; Select the Student Names &gt; <span class="Name">Send</span></p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/FMJoinos18.png" />
