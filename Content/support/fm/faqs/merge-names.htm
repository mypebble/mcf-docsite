        <h1>How do I merge two names in Fund Manager?</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue: </span> I have two names records in Fund Manager that belong to the same pupil; how do I consolidate them and ensure the merged record retains all transactions?</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution: </span>In <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Names</span> search for and open the name you want to retain as the <span class="Name">Primary Record</span> for the pupil:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>	Click the <span class="Name">Consolidate Pupil</span> tab and search for  the name you want to merge with your <span class="Name">Primary Contact</span></li>
            <li>Click on the radio button to select the name as your <span class="Name">Secondary Record</span></li>
            <li>Click on <span class="Name">Preview Consolidation</span> to see a list of transactions and other items that will be affected by the consolidation</li>
            <li>The list of items affected can include <span class="Name">Receipts</span>, <span class="Name">Payments</span>, <span class="Name">Transfers</span>, <span class="Name">Taken Items</span>, <span class="Name">Phone Numbers</span>, <span class="Name">Addresses</span>, <span class="Name">Email Addresses</span>, <span class="Name">Joinos Codes</span>, <span class="Name">sQuid Cards</span> depending on what information is associated to each contact</li>
            <li>Once you have confirmed the <span class="Name">Number Being Moved</span>, <span class="Name">Total Value Transferred</span> and <span class="Name">Number Being Discarded</span> are correct, click <span class="Name">Confirm</span> to complete the consolidation</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Name">Consolidate Names</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Consolidating names will merge and discard the items displayed – this action cannot be reversed. This will also mark the <span class="Name">Secondary Record</span> as <span class="Name">Out Of Use</span>.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Name">Primary Record</span> will now show the contact information consolidated from the <span class="Name">Secondary Record</span> at the bottom</p>
        <p>If you are consolidating two contacts who are both GiftAid donors, you will need to select the designated GiftAid donor for the merged record before you can create a new Claim for Donations</p>
