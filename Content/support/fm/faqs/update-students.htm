        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue:</span>  I don’t or can’t use <span class="Name">*MISapp</span>, how can I update my Student names within Fund Manager.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution:</span>   Create a file of Student names to send to Pebble to be uploaded to Fund Manager.</p>
        <p>Although the information given here is directed at Sims.net users, this file can be generated from any Student Management programme by using the Fields as defined below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click Reports</li>
            <li>Click Design</li>
            <li>	Click Create a New Report</li>

            <li>Click On Roll</li>
            <li>Click Next</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At this point you will identify the <span class="Emphasis">fields</span> required for the .csv file.</p>
        <p>From the list on your right, select the first 3 fields. Highlight and Double Click on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Surname</li>

            <li>UPN</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then click:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Next.</li>
            <li>Next – if no filter is to be applied.</li>
            <li>Next – if no sort order is required.</li>
            <li>Next – if no effective date is required.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To create this as a .csv file you must select TEXT from the types of file offered. You will then see a box with comma separated highlighted and an empty field box in which you will enter the file name. Use the filename (Students.csv) and save this to your Desktop.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select 'Next' and click on 'Run my Report'</li>
        </ul>
