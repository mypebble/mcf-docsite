        <h1>How can I see who has or hasn’t paid?</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue:  </span>I want to be able to check an account and see who has or who hasn't’ paid.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution:</span>  In order to run the Who’s Not Paid reports a Unit Cost must be assigned to an account.  It will also be helpful to add the Student/Staff into a Named Group to make searching easier.</p>
        <p>To add Students and Staff to a group, please see the section <i>To Create a New Group</i> in the <a href="../user-guides/manage-names.htm#NewGroup">Managing Names User Guide</a>.</p>
        <p>For More information on Unit Cost please see the section <i>Unit Cost</i> in the <a href="../user-guides/manage-accounts.htm#UnitCost">Managing Accounts User Guide</a>.</p>
        <h4>To see who hasn’t paid</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <span class="Name">Reports &gt; Who’s Not Paid</span></li>
            <li>Select the Account you need to view (this will only show those accounts with Unit Costs)</li>
            <li>Select any <span class="Name">Dates</span> you wish to limit the search to</li>
            <li>Select either the <span class="Name">Year</span>, <span class="Name">Class</span> or <span class="Name">Group</span> you wish to view</li>
            <li>Click Search</li>
            <p>This then produces a list of names with their payments and Outstanding Balances</p>
        </ol>
        <p class="Tip" MadCap:autonum="Tip: ">Should you also want to include in the Report all the ones who <i>have</i> paid in Full, then tick the box for <span class="Name">Show Paid Balances</span> before clicking Search.</p>
