        <h1>How do I re-register Joinos students?</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue: </span>A parent has contacted me to say that they can’t see their child in Joinos; how do I reconcile this in Fund Manager?</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution:</span> Joinos codes expire after three months if they have not been used.</p>
        <p>With regard to the children whose Joinos codes have expired, you will need to recreate their Joinos codes and then inform the parents to use this new code.</p>
        <p>To do this click on <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Create Joinos Codes</span> and filter for their names.</p>
        <p>If you can't find them in the list click the Show Registered button and they should appear in there.</p>
        <p>Click on the Tick box to the left of their name and click <span class="Name">Create Joinos Code</span> button</p>
        <p>Click on the <span class="Name">Joinos Codes</span> tab and their name should be showing with the new code.</p>
