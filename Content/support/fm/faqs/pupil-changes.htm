        <h1>How can I see which pupil records have changed in Fund Manager?</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution: </span>The Manage Names screen allows you to see the pupil records that have been updated over a user-defined period within Fund Manager.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Method:  </span>To see a list of the pupil names that have been updated, go to:</p>
        <p><span class="Name">Fund Manager &gt; Administration &gt; Manage Names</span>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>	Select Updated Names</li>
            <li>Select your chosen date range (the range is ‘today’ by default)</li>
            <li>Click Search</li>
            <p>This will give you a summary of the number of new, deleted and changed contacts between the two dates:</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>To see the list of names that have been updated in each category, simply click on one of the buttons</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The New list contains all contacts that have been added to Fund Manager within the chosen date range. This includes both contacts that have been added automatically (via MIS App, Import Names) and those that have been added manually (via <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Names &gt; Create New Name</span>)</li>
                <li>The Deleted list contains all contacts that are still appearing in Fund Manager but have been removed from Sims (or other management tool) and are no longer being updated as part of the import. For example, the names of students or staff who have left. You can use this feature to identify names that need to be marked ‘out of use’ within Fund Manager.  Select all those names that you have confirmed have left by clicking on the small box in the left column and then click the <span class="Name">Mark name(s) as out of use</span> button.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Changed list contains all contacts whose information has been changed within the chosen date range. This includes contacts whose information has been updated from Sims automatically (via MIS App, Import Names) or that has been updated manually</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Updates to any information within <span class="Name">Administration &gt;  Manage Names &gt; Update Pupil</span> will cause a contact to appear within the Changed list. This includes changes to Forename, Surname, Year, Class, Reg Group, Contact Name, Contact Address etc. It is not currently possible to see the specific information that has changed.</p>
