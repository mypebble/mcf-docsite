            <MadCap:concept term="Corrections" />How can I correct the value of a cashed cheque?</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue:</span> I have used the Bank &amp; Cash Menu/Draw Cheque for Cash to draw a cheque for cash and the amount was entered incorrectly, how do I alter the cheque?</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution: </span>If the amount was too low, draw another cheque; if the amount was too high, from the School Fund Manager main menu, use the options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bank &amp; Cash Menu</li>
            <li>Pay Receipts into Bank</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To pay the excess back into the bank</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Method:</span> As you are unable to cancel the ‘draw cheque for cash’ transaction proceed as follows. From the Fund Manager menus, use the options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><![CDATA[	]]><span class="Name">Bank &amp; Cash Menu &gt; Pay Receipts into Bank</span></li>
            <li>Make up a Paying in Slip to return the cash funds back to the bank</li>
            <li>Return to Bank and Cash Menu/Draw cheque for cash and enter the correct amount</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: "> When making these amending entries use cheque / paying-in slip numbers outside your current range e.g. 00001 if possible - try not to make it a larger number than the one you are using currently.</p>
