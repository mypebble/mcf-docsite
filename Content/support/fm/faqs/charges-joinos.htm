            <MadCap:concept term="Charges;Joinos" />How can I record Joinos Charges?</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue:</span> When I receive my Bank Statement I find Charges, how do I reflect this in Fund Manager?</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution:</span> There are three steps for dealing with this.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In your Fund Manager, your monies are brought back into your Joinos Settlement Account, you must transfer the <span class="Emphasis">GROSS</span> to your Current Account (or desired bank account) - This will show as a Debit from the Joinos account and a Credit against your Current Account.</li>
            <li>Once you have transferred your amounts you must now record the charges. You <span class="Emphasis">MUST</span> record these back in against your Current Account as a Direct Debit and NOT against the Settlement Account. Before you record the transaction, you will need to create a user account called 'Joinos Charges' and a name to match. Please enter these in your Administration screen.</li>
            <li>You will now be ready to record the transaction, to do this, go to Transactions&gt;Payments - In this screen you will now select your newly created user account (Joinos Charges) and of course, your new name. Fill out the relevant information and the amount of your charge then select your Type as Direct Debit - Here you must ensure you bank account (in the centre of your payments screen) is your Current Account. - Finally, select save.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You will now have your original <span class="Emphasis">gross</span> transfer and the direct debit refund/charge against your current account ready to reconcile.</p>
