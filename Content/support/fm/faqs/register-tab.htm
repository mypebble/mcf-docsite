        <h1>How do I use the Register tab?</h1>
        <p>The Register tab allows Users to Record attendance for various Items, Meals, Clubs, Events.</p>
        <p>Money received for a Register Account is Receipted through Fund Manager and then Recorded as attended in the Register tab.  The Register function then Reports on these Taken Items and debits the Pupils Money previously credited to that Register Account.</p>
        <p>If you would like to add the Register tab to your Fund Manager then please contact us.</p>
        <p>Access the Register options in the Register Tab:</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>To use the Register feature you must ensure that the Account that you would like to Record Attendance against has been Created or Amended in the following way:</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Go to</span> &gt; Administration &gt; Manage Accounts</p>
        <p>Either <span class="Emphasis">Create a New Account </span>from the bottom of the screen or Amend an existing Account by clicking  the blue Account link.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/FMFAQReg02.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The example in the screenshot is for an After School Club:</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Click</span> &gt; Register Account</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Define an Exclusion Group</span> &gt; This is a Group that would not be expected to pay for the Item you are going to Record Attendance against in the Register tab.  You must have an Exclusion Group even if it has no Pupils in the Group, you can Name this Group anything you like, we have used the example ‘FREE’.  Add any Pupils to this Group that will not be expected to pay for this Item in the usual way from the Administration &gt; Manage Names screen.</p>
        <p>If you need to Create a New Group you can click on the ‘Manage Groups’ to the right of the Exclusion Group dropdown box to Create this.</p>
