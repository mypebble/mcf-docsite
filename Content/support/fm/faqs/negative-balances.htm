        <h1>How can I transfer a negative balance from one user account to another?</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue: </span>   I have tried to transfer a negative (overdrawn) amount from one user account to another. When I enter a '-' (minus) sign in front of the amount I get an error "You are trying to transfer a negative amount, switch the Transfer From and Transfer To if this is the intention." What do I do?</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution: </span>Transfer a positive amount in the opposite direction.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are still in the Transfer Screen, then switch the <span class="Name">Transfer From</span> and <span class="Name">Transfer To</span> Accounts round.</li>
            <li>If you are not in the Transfer Screen</li>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="Name">Transactions &gt;&#160;Transfer Between Accounts</span>
                </li>
                <li>Select user accounts in the OPPOSITE sense i.e. instead of selecting the FROM account then the TO account in order to enter a negative amount</li>
                <li>Enter a positive amount</li>
                <li>Enter the relevant date for the Transfer</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Enter the reason for the Transfer in the <span class="Name">Notes</span> Field</p>
                </li>
                <li>Click <span class="Name">Transfer</span></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
