        <h1>How do I resolve a bounced cheque?</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue:    </span>Cheque(s) that have been received and subsequently taken to the bank have now been returned to me as 'Refer to Drawer.'</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution:</span>   The value of the cheque needs to be removed from Fund Manager.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">   Do not cancel the original cheque receipt or alter the original paying-in slip.  This will appear on your Bank Statement as a Debit and a Credit which will need to be reconciled.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Method:</span> To reduce the value of the cheque(s) received from the User Account, Bank Account and Name.</p>
        <p>From the Fund Manager main menu, select <span class="Name">Transactions &gt; Record a Payment</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select the User Account against which the cheque was received</li>
            <li>	In <span class="Name">Description</span> type 'Cheque returned by Bank</li>
            <li>	Enter an appropriate date</li>
            <li>	Enter <span class="Name">Type</span> as a direct debit</li>
            <li>Select the <span class="Name">Bank</span> account the cheque was paid-in to. This bank account will now be reduced by the value of the cheque</li>
            <li>Enter the <span class="Name">Amount </span>of the cheque</li>
            <li>Enter any extra <span class="Name">Notes</span> you need to make</li>
            <li>Select the <span class="Name">Name</span> from whom you received the cheque</li>
            <li>Click on <span class="Name">Save</span> or <span class="Name">Save &amp; Print</span> to save your transaction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This direct debit transaction will need to be reconciled when the transaction appears on your bank statement.</p>
        <p>This will reduce the balance of the User Account and record a 'payment' against the name of the person from whom the cheque was received. It will also create a direct debit against the bank account. The 'value' of the cheque receipt has been negated.</p>
