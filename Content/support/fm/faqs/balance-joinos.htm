            <MadCap:concept term="Payments;Joinoa;Trips" />How can I let a parent see what’s left to pay towards a trip in Joinos?</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue: </span>I want parents to pay a deposit for a school trip to secure their child’s place; how can I make sure they see the remaining balance that’s left to pay?</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution:</span> It is now possible to choose to share the balance of an account via Joinos so parents are able to see what’s left to pay on an offer</p>
        <p>In the <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Accounts</span> screen:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose the account for the offer that you want to share</li>
            <li>Ensure that the account is marked <span class="Name">In Use</span>; if it isn’t, populate the checkbox to update it</li>
            <li>Populate the <span class="Name">Share Balances</span> checkbox to instruct Fund Manager to share all outstanding balances for offers associated to the account</li>
            <li>Create the offer as usual via the <span class="Name">Offers &gt; Create Offer</span> screen</li>
            <li>Populate the <span class="Name">Unspecified</span> checkbox and enter the minimum amount you would like parents to pay</li>
            <li>Add any relevant attachments, select names then post the offer to make it visible to parents</li>
            <li>Once a parent has paid their deposit, they will be able to see what they have left to pay via the <span class="Name">Balances</span> tab in Joinos</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Only offers where a parent has expressed an interest by paying something towards the total amount will be displayed</p>
