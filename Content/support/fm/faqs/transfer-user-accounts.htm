        <h1>How do I transfer between user accounts or user names?</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue:</span> I need to transfer funds between users accounts.</p>
        <p>It is possible to transfer money between User Accounts. These are the transfers referred to when we indicate whether to Include or Exclude transfers from User Account Balances.</p>
        <p>There are two different transfer options, listed below:</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">1.</span> The standard transfer is between two User Accounts without reference to a 'name'. E.g. if you have a General or Miscellaneous User Account you may choose to transfer any under spend from a visit or trip to this account. Alternatively any shortfalls can be met by transferring funds from User Accounts with a surplus of money.</p>
        <h4>Method:</h4>
        <p>From the main menu of Fund Manager, use the options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transactions</li>
            <li><b>Transfer Between User Accounts</b>
            </li>
            <li>Using the cursor arrows, select the user account which you want to transfer money FROM and press enter. (If you know the user account code, you will be able to type this into the Search field)</li>
            <li>Again using the cursor arrows, select the user account which you want to transfer money TO and click OK. (If you know the user account code, you will be able to type this into the Search field)</li>
            <li>Type in the amount of money you would like to transfer, enter the date and the reason for the transfer in the Notes field</li>
            <li>Click Transfer</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">2. </span>The second option is  between two User Accounts with a name assigned to the transfer. This can be used to transfer between two different User Accounts and/or two different names.</p>
        <p>Method:</p>
        <p>From the main menu of Fund Manager, use the options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transactions</li>
            <li><b>Transfer Between Names</b>
            </li>
            <li>Using the cursor arrows, select the user account which you want to transfer money FROM - (If you know the user account code, you will be able to type this into the Search field)</li>
            <li>Select the user name associated with the account you want to transfer money from</li>
            <li>Again using the cursor arrows, select the user account which you want to transfer money TO and click OK. (If you know the user account code, you will be able to type this into the Search field)</li>
            <li>Select the user name associated with the account you want to transfer money to</li>
            <li>Type in the amount of money you would like to transfer, enter the date and the reason for the transfer in the Notes field</li>
            <li>Click Transfer</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">The transfers MUST have a ‘Note’ against them in order to transfer.</p>
