        <h1>How do I add a new name to transact against?</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue:</span>   I am currently creating a receipt/payment and haven’t got a name to put the transaction against.   Can I create a new name without leaving the receipt/payment?</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution:</span>  Enter a new name or organisation.</p>
        <p>Complete all the fields for the transaction and in the Names section, click the Manage Names button at the bottom right.  This will take you to the Manage Names Screen where you can create a new Organisation or Name.  If you are not sure how to do this click <a href="../user-guides/manage-names.htm">here</a></p>
        <p>Once this is complete you can return to your Receipt/Payment entry and choose the name in the Names field.  All the other information you have already entered will have been retained.</p>
