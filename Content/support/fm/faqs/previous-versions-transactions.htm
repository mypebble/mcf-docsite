        <h1>How do I record unpresented debits and credits processed in a previous version?</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Question: </span>How do I record credits and debits given that were processed in a previous version so I can reconcile my bank statement?</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution: </span>Use the accounts created in your Fund Manager setup called UPCS and UPDS to record the necessary receipt/payments.</p>
        <p>Within Fund Manager go to <span class="Name">Reports &gt; Search Account Balances</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li>check to see if you have accounts called <span class="Emphasis">UPCS</span> (Unpresented Credits) or <span class="Emphasis">UPDS</span> (Unpresented Debits)</li>
            <li>If they are not on the accounts list but there are items on your bank statement that <span class="Emphasis">DO NOT</span> appear in the list of items to be reconciled, please contact Pebble Support at support@mypebble.co.uk. Support will help you determine the value of these unreconciled transactions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">In Fund Manager, you will need to record receipts and payments as and ONLY when these entries appear on your Bank statements.</p>
        <h4>Method:</h4>
        <h4>To record Credits</h4>
        <p>Enter <span class="Name">Receipt(s)</span> that reflect the item(s) on your statement, this will increase the balance of UPCS accounts until it is eventually back to zero:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose (UPCS) Unpresented Credits as the account</li>
            <li>Enter the description as ‘Unreconciled transaction from previous system’</li>
            <li>Enter the transactions as a direct credit, (this is because you have already paid these items into the bank in your previous version)</li>
            <li>Choose the correct bank account, recording the date as the date on the statement, amount of the transaction and choose who the money was received from on the list of names.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Creating new names if necessary to complete the process, save or save and print at the bottom</p>
        <h4>To record Debits</h4>
        <p>Enter <span class="Name">Payment(s)</span> that reflect the item(s) on your statement, this will reduce the balance of UPDS accounts back to zero:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose (UPDS) <span class="Name">Unpresented Debits</span> as the account</li>
            <li>Enter the description as ‘Unreconciled transaction from previous system’</li>
            <li>Enter the transactions as a direct debit</li>
            <li>Choose the correct bank account, recording the date as the date on the statement, amount of the transaction and choose who the money was paid to on the list of names.</li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Creating new names if necessary to complete the process, save or save and print at the bottom</p>
            <p>You will see the balances of your <span class="Name">UPDS</span> and <span class="Name">UPCS</span> accounts reducing back to zero as you use up your balances. Return to the reconciliation of your bank statement and tick these receipts/payments to reconcile them.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are left with a value in the <span class="Name">UPDS</span> or <span class="Name">UPCS</span> accounts at the end of the financial period this is most likely due to a cheque or credit that has never reached or been presented to your bank account.</p>
        <p>You can choose to transfer any residual value of unpresented debits back to the account from which the original cheques were written.</p>
