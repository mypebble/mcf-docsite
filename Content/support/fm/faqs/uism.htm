        <h1>How do I record the Universal Infant Free School Meals  being taken?</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue: </span>From September 2014, all pupils in reception, year 1 and year 2 in state-funded schools in England will be eligible for free school meals (UIFSMs). How can I record the number being taken by each pupil?</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution: </span>To record the number of UIFSMs being taken you will need to create a new group to which you can assign your eligible pupils. In <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Names</span>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the <span class="Name">Create Group</span> button and enter the name you would like to use for your UIFSM group. Choose “User Defined” as the <span class="Name">Group Type</span></li>
            <li>Select the pupils who are eligible for UIFSMs using the checkboxes to the left of their names</li>
            <li>Select your UIFSM group in <span class="Name">Group Actions</span> and click <span class="Name">Add to Group</span>. This will add the eligible pupils you selected to your new UIFSM group</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In order to record the number of UIFSMs being taken, you will need to assign your UIFSM group to your Register Account. Go to <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Accounts</span>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click on the name of your Register Account to bring up the <span class="Name">Update Account</span> screen</li>
            <li>	Select your <span class="Name">UIFSM Group</span> from the dropdown list of groups</li>
            <li>	Once you have assigned a UIFSM Group to your register account, all items taken by pupils in this group will be recorded as “U” (UIFSM)</li>
            <li>If you have pupils who are eligible for Pupil Premium free meals, these take precedence over Universal Infant Free School Meals. If this is the case, select your Pupil Premium group in the <span class="Name">Exclusion Group</span> box. Meals taken by these pupils will be recorded as “F” (Free).</li>
            <li>Meals taken by pupils not eligible for Pupil Premium free meals or UIFSM will be recorded as “P” (Paid)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can view the number of meals being taken in several different ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>	Via <span class="Name">Register &gt; Taken Items</span></li>
            <li>	Via <span class="Name">Register &gt; Names Summary</span></li>
            <li>	Via <span class="Name">Register &gt; Statement</span></li>
            <li>Via <span class="Name">Register &gt; Universal Free School Meals</span></li>
        </ul>
