        <h1>How do I reconcile a bank statement?</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue: </span>I have received the latest statement for my bank account; how do I reconcile this in Fund Manager?</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution: </span>Reconciliation is the process whereby you and the bank agree the transactions that have been entered and cleared on each bank account. As soon as the bank statement(s) arrives you should tick the items that match those on Fund Manager. Transactions may remain Unreconciled for some time, especially if cheques you have raised to someone fail to be presented.</p>
        <p>In the <span class="Name">Bank &amp; Cash &gt; Reconcile a Bank Statement </span>screen:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select the bank account that you want to reconcile</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Name">Reconcile this account</span></li>
            <li>Enter the <span class="Name">First Page</span>, <span class="Name">Last Page</span>, <span class="Name">Start Date</span>, <span class="Name">End Date</span> and <span class="Name">Closing Balance</span> details from the statement you are reconciling</li>
            <li>The <span class="Name">Opening Balance</span> should always match the figure on the last bank statement you reconciled</li>
            <li>Select the Fund Manager transactions that match those on your bank statement</li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">You can only reconcile transactions that lie inside of your start and end date.</p>
            <li>Click <span class="Name">Reconcile</span></li>
            <li>You will now see a list of all your reconciled bank statements</li>
            <li>When you have completed your reconciliation you can print it out via Bank &amp; Cash &gt; List Reconciled Bank Accounts</li>
            <li>Click on the <span class="Name">Start Date</span> OR <span class="Name">End Date</span> of the reconciliation you want to print</li>
            <li>This will display the statement for your reconciliation</li>
            <li><span class="Name">Print</span> the report from the bottom left hand side of the screen</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">If you leave a bank reconciliation part way through, when you re-enter the reconciliation screen you will be returned to the part-completed statement. You MUST complete or abandon the reconciliation before you can proceed, irrespective of how many bank accounts you have.</p>
