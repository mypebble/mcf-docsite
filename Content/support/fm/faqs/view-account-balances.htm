        <h1>How can I see my account balances?</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue:</span> When I check the balance of one of my accounts in ‘Accounts Summary’, ‘Search Transactions’ and ‘Search Account Balances’, the balance amounts can be different, why?</p>
        <p>A balance is a calculated value, each of these reports display a different set of transactions so the calculation may produce a different result.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution:</span> There are three reports where a balance can be seen</p>
        <p>From the <span class="Name">Reports tab</span> in Fund Manager</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Name">Accounts Summary</span>
            </li>
            <p>This Report displays only the Income and Expenditure for the Current Period and the Balance of those Transactions. Transfer values can be included or excluded from this Report, by default they are excluded. If you choose to ‘Include’ transfers, their values will be added to the receipts and payments totals.</p>
            <li><span class="Name">Search Transactions</span>
            </li>
            <p>If you select a single account this Report will display the same values and balances as the Accounts Summary report, however here the transfer values are included by default. On this Report they are specifically identified as transfers and are NOT added to the receipts and payments totals.</p>
            <li><span class="Name">Search Account Balances</span>
            </li>
            <p>This Report is the most comprehensive; for each account it includes an Opening Balance, Receipts, Payments, Transfers and a Balance.</p>
        </ul>
