        <h1>How do I deal with unpresented cheques?</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue:</span>  Cheque(s) I have written have not appeared on a bank statement, but are waiting on the list of items to be reconciled (Bank and Cash menu&gt; Reconcile Bank Statement) and are now over six months old.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Solution:</span>   This depends on whether the cheque(s) were written in a 'current' financial period. If the cheque(s) were written in a financial period that has subsequently been closed use Method 1. If they were written in the current financial period, use Method 2.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this process is to 'write-back' the value of the cheque/s.</p>
        <h4>Method 1</h4>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">For cheque(s) written in a financial period which has been closed:</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Name">Transactions &gt; Enter a Receipt</span>
            </li>
            <li>Select the User Account against which the cheque was written. (If this User Account is not available in the current year select an appropriate alternative.)</li>
            <li>Select the name of the payee</li>
            <li>	In the Description' field type:  Unpresented cheque timed out</li>
            <li>	Enter the amount of the cheque</li>
            <li>	Choose type as a direct credit</li>
            <li>Then select the bank account the cheque was drawn against</li>
            <li>Enter an appropriate date</li>
            <li>	Both the direct credit transaction and the unpresented cheque must be reconciled, therefore go to Bank and Cash menu/Reconcile Bank Statement and reconcile them</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Method 2</h4>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">For cheque(s) written in the current financial period:</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Name">Transactions &gt; Cancel Receipt or Payment transaction</span>
            </li>
            <li>Find the transaction for the cheque</li>
            <li>click on the radio button in the left column for the transaction and click Continue</li>
            <li>In the Reason for Cancellation field type Unpresented cheque timed out</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cancelling the payment transaction will remove the item for the reconciliation list. You may see the details of this cancelled cheque payment from the Amendments Menu/List of Cancelled and Amended Receipts and Payments.</p>
