        <h1>Pebble In-App Support</h1>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>This document defines the level of service that Fund Manager and Grant Search users will receive from Pebble Support within their system via in-app messaging. This includes response times, resolution expectations and the process for triaging and escalating queries.</p>
        <h4>In-App Messaging</h4>
        <p>Pebble’s Fund Manager and Grant Search systems use Intercom as their in-app messaging solution. Intercom is intended to provide Pebble system users with an online, interactive method to request and receive basic information and troubleshooting assistance. Support is provided on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
        <h4>Message Handling &amp; Response Times</h4>
        <p>Incoming Intercom messages are handled by Pebble’s Support Team and are queued along with incoming telephone calls and emails. Incoming messages are triaged and assigned priority and /or escalated based on the nature of the query. Users will receive a response to their query within four hours, and can expect to receive a resolution for standard queries within 48 hours.</p>
        <h4>Escalating Non-Standard Queries</h4>
        <p>Non-standard queries received through Intercom will be raised as new Support Tickets and will be managed via the Pebble Support Service Desk using the standard procedure. Users will be notified via Intercom of their Support Ticket reference and how they can expect their ticket to be handled. Support Tickets may be escalated to the Head of Support, referred to the Development Team or assigned “Complex” status depending on the nature of the query.</p>
