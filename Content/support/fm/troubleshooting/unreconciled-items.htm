        <p>In Fund Manager go to <span class="Name">Bank &amp; Cash &gt; Bank History</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select the <span class="Name">Bank Account</span> you wish to see the unreconciled items for</li>
            <li>Go to <span class="Name">Status</span> and select "Unreconciled" from the dropdown menu</li>
            <li>Select the dates from and to (or leave blank to see all unreconciled items for your current financial period)</li>

        <p>You will now see a list of all your existing unreconciled items that you can either print or export to CSV</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">You will only be able to see the outstanding unreconciled items from the financial period you are transacting in. In order to see historical items that are still unreconciled, you will need to start the reconciliation process for your bank account.</p>
