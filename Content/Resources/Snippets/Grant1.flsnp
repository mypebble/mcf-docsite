        <p>Have a look at the grant details. </p>
        <p>When you view a grant, read the funding organisation’s terms and conditions to see if you qualify, are able to apply for it and whether getting the grant will support your project aims and vision.</p>
        <p>If so, then find out what you can about projects the funding organisation has previously funded as this will assist you when you make your own application.</p>
