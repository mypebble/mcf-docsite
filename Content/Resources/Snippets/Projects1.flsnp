        <p>Projects are the fuel to your school or organisational objectives. So if one of your school objectives is to provide both high quality and a diverse set of sports, then one of your projects may be redeveloping your sports hall to cater for more than just football. Applying for a grant for your sports facility, for example, may be an activity you undertake to accomplish your project.</p>
