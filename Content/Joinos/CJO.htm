        <h1>Joinos Offers</h1>
        <p>Parents won’t be able to buy or pay for anything in Joinos unless you create an Offer within Fund Manager and make this available to the relevant pupils.</p>
        <p>Offers can be simple e.g. one-off with full payment up-front, or more complex e.g. recurring offers which can accept multiple payments. Some things should only be purchased once by parents e.g. a school trip, while other items, such as rugby shirts could be ordered and paid for more than once (the parent might need to buy a shirt in a bigger size when their child outgrows the one they had bought before, or the parent might want to buy their child two shirts).</p>
        <h3>To create an offer</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Open <span class="Name">Fund Manager &gt; Offers &gt;&#160;Create Offer</span>.</li>
            <li>Select an account and if the amount is for a third party, select <span class="Name">Settle With Third Party</span>.</li>
            <li>Enter the offer <span class="Name">Title</span> and a description, if required.</li>
            <li>Enter the cost of the offer in the <span class="Name">Amount</span> field.</li>
            <li>If you want to offer payment by instalments, then select <span class="Name">Unspecified</span> and enter the minimum amount you accept for an instalment in the <span class="Name">Minimum</span> box.</li>
            <li>Enter the <span class="Name">Offer Dates</span> and if the offer is recurring (you will offer the same thing more than once), select <span class="Name">Recurring</span>.</li>
            <li>Enter details about the offer quantities, the <span class="Name">Min</span>imum number of items each parent can purchase and the <span class="Name">Max</span>imum number of <span class="Name">Items Available</span>. If there is no limit, select <span class="Name">Unlimited</span>.</li>
            <li>Select any attachments that go with the offer, if there are any. </li>
            <p class="Tip">If you have documents that you want to attach to the offer and they don’t show up as available then you need to upload the documents first. For more information see, <a href="#Upload">To upload documents to attach to offers</a>.</p>

        <h3>To share outstanding balances </h3>
        <p>You can display outstanding balances for parents who are paying by instalment on the <span class="Name">Payments</span> tab within the parent’s Joinos account. </p>
        <p class="note">Balances are only shown when parents are paying by instalments so they can check how much they still have to pay.</p>
        <p>To do this, you need to select <span class="Name">Share Balances</span> on the account which is being used for the offer:</p>
        <ol>

            <li>Choose the account for the offer you want to share.</li>
            <li>Ensure In Use is selected for the account.</li>
            <li>Select the <span class="Name">Share Balances</span> check box. </li>
            <p class="note">This instructs Fund Manager to share all outstanding balances for offers associated with the account.</p>
