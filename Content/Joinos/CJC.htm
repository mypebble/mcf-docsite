        <h1>Joinos Codes</h1>
        <p>Joinos codes are used by parents to access Joinos and pay for trips and activities for their child. A parent needs a Joinos code for each child as the code is unique to the child.</p>
        <p>You can create Joinos codes within Fund Manager, using the <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Create Joinos Codes</span> option. All students and staff who are waiting to be registered on Joinos are listed. This includes all new students and staff at the school or those who have never been registered.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Joinos codes expire after three months so if a pupil has already registered but their parent or carer has never used the code you gave them, you will need to recreate a Joinos code for them.</p>
