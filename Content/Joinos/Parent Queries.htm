        <h1>Dealing with queries from parents</h1>
        <p>This chapter discusses how best to deal with parent queries about using Joinos to add children, shop for offers, make payments for trips or ask about their account balance.</p>
        <p>In the past, parents have become frustrated by attempts to get answers to their queries about their Joinos account. This is because they asked us first for answers to questions that only you can answer. The support model looked like this:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="images/Joinos Support Old Model.png" />
        </p>
        <p>As you can see parents will likely have had a conversation with  the Joinos Helpdesk before coming to you with their query and as you know it is frustrating to ask a number of times before getting an answer. </p>
        <p>In order to help you have more direct communication with parents for issues which only you can solve, we have created a new Help and Support Dashboard in Joinos which looks like this.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="images/HelpAndSupport.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Queries about balances, shopping and payments will come through to you from parents directly as emails. There is also a direct route for a parent to let you know they need a Joinos code for their child. All other queries will continue to come direct to the Joinos Helpdesk.</p>
        <p>This means that parents will be in touch with you before they are in touch with Joinos Helpdesk about the issues that only you can help them with. The new model looks like this:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="images/Joinos Support New Model.png" />
        </p>
        <p>This means parents won’t have wasted time contacting Joinos Helpdesk when we can’t help them, and you won’t receive telephone calls ad hoc from parents who are already frustrated because they have been in touch with us first. Getting emails from parents instead of phone calls means that you can plan your day better, putting aside a time to answer the emails instead of being on and off the phone throughout the day as the queries come in. It also means that you will have a written trail of the issues parents are having so you will be able to track and iron out the issues more easily.</p>
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>When parents click <span class="Name">Get help</span> on the appropriate icon on the new <span class="Name">Help and Support Dashboard</span>, they are led step-by-step to select the issue they are having, the school their child is with and write a description of the issue. When they click <span class="Name">Send</span>, an email is automatically generated and sent to the school.</p>
        <h3>Adding a child</h3>
        <p>Provided you have given a Joinos code to the parent, parents can add their own children on Joinos. They will need a separate code for each child. </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="images/AddNewChild.png" style="width: 171px;height: 213px;" />
        </p>
        <p>When parents need to add the child they click on <span class="Name">Add a new child</span> and if they have a Joinos code for the child, they are led step-by-step to create the details in Joinos. If they don’t have a code, they are prompted to contact the school for one.</p>
        <p>For more information on creating and issuing Joinos codes, see <MadCap:xref href="CJC.htm">Joinos Codes</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Aide Memoire - what  you need to do</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and issue Joinos codes for pupils from Fund Manager.</li>
            <li>Create offers in Fund Manager for parents to see in Joinos.</li>
            <li>Send messages to parents from within Fund Manager</li>
            <li>Expect email enquiries from parents to come to you direct about balances, offers and payments on their Joinos account. </li>
            <p>For example, parents may not be able to see the offer as their child might not have been included in it or parents may want to ask you for a refund on their account or to move balances between their children’s accounts.</p>
            <li>Plan your work day to schedule a time to deal with and reply to these email queries.</li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="Note: ">Over time you will see a drop-off in phone calls and an increase in email enquires as parents begin to use the new <span class="Name">Help and Support Dashboard</span>. This will help you to plan your working day better.</p>
        </ul>
